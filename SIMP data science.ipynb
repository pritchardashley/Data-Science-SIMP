    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everywhere we go, campus, a park, or even a big city, there will be squirrels. There are over 280 species of squirrels around the world (1) and come in a variety of colors: Black, brown, grey, red, and even containing purple, orange, and maroon (2) Research has found that squirrels have personalities and similar behaviors to humans (3). There has also been some research into the patterns of dominance in squirrels with older squirrels being more aggressive than younger squirrels and similar patterns for larger and smaller squirrels (4). There is a lot more to learn about squirrels and how and why they behave the ways that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of our interest on this topic stems from our personal observations, specifically with the squirrels on the University of Utah campus. We as a group concluded that the level of human interactions, and food availability may have impacted their behaviors in certain situations. The squirrels on the University of Utah campus even have their own portion of the University of Utah website dedicated to them (University of Utah Website) as well as an annual “Squirrel Fest” held by the Natural History Museum (Squirrel Fest). Although the data set of squirrels that we will be using is not based in Utah, we feel as though we can learn a lot of information, through the application of skills learned in class, to gain a better understanding of the squirrels in Utah and around the world. \n"

    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary question that we want to try to answer within our project is if there is a strong correlation between the physical characteristics and location of the squirrels in central park and their observed behaviors. The specific characteristics that we are focusing on are fur color, highlighted fur color, age, and location of the squirrels. In a part of this we want to see if the squirrels that show fear towards interactions with humans have different characteristics than those squirrels that do not. Our null hypothesis is that the physical characteristics have no effect on behavioral observations and our alternative hypothesis is that the physical characteristics have an effect on the observed behaviors. \t\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Our learning objective is to utilize what we have learned in class to perform an accurate analysis of our data. Potential skills we hope to apply and understand more deeply include but are not limited to: R-squared, P-value, OLS Regression, descriptive statistics, categorical data, dummy values, data clean, and data visualization. Another thing we want to look into is creating a map of the squirrels in Central Park that shows our results for better visualization.\n"

    "Our data comes from the 2018 NYC Squirrel Census. This was a citizen science project that had volunteers observing squirrels in Central Park in New York City. The data is in two CSV files, as well as a word document with data definitions. The first file has our primary data, which includes 3022 observations. Each observation has 7 columns identifying the location, time, date, etc for the observation. There are 23 different columns with boolean or nominal values for different attributes of the observed squirrel, such as color (grey, cinnamon or black), what the squirrel was doing(eating, foraging, etc.), and behaviors it displayed, including vocalizations or interactions with humans. The second file is a CSV containing the latitude and longitude of the hectares that the park was broken into for the observations. \n",

    "The group that would be the most affected by our analysis would be the squirrel community within central park. Depending on what we find in our analysis it could encourage people to interact more with squirrels. This, in turn, could lead to the endangerment of the squirrels or an increase of stress onto them. If people are influenced to interact with the squirrels it could also lead to the transmission of disease between the squirrels and humans. With a possible influx of people interacting with squirrels this would also mean a direct increase of people to central park. This could affect other aspects of the park outside of the squirrel population like people straying off paths or stepping on plants. \n"
