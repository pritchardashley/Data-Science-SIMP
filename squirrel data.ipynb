       "'Observed a squirrel with a cache of peanuts that he was eating. Strangely, none of the other squirrels were eating those peanuts. Lots of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, food vendors, bike rental guys, city workers doing something with the fountain in Columbus Circle, but not a squirrel to be seen. \\n\\nA bike rental worker telling prospective customers about Central Park, \"... 21 playgrounds, three restaurants ...\" — no quote on the number of squirrels, not yet! Three of the pedicab drivers (14 pedicabs lined up) put out mats to pray. White Rolls Royce and stretch limo waiting for bridal party. Lots of birds bathing in the fountains in Columbus Circle. Squirrels were in surrounding grass areas/trees. Almost none on concrete/sidewalk/road area. There is a large pigeon population on the Maine Monument, so this may be deterring squirrels from leaving grassy area. \"SQUIRREL APALOOZA\"\\n\\n6+7 were playing on tree trunk \\n\\nNests spotted: 111     [?]\\n\\nSquirrel #11: There was a bag of nuts or trail mix under a tree - pigeons were eating at it - squirrel would come up + fight pigeons off, get a nut + go eat it a bit away. Pigeons come back, squirrel finishes nut, then goes back to bag + fights them off again - repeat Counted 10 squirrels of different varieties. Mostly brown cinnamon with gray tails. What are the chances for running into two Norwegian tourists who love squirrels. They would have volunteered except they leave for Norway tomorrow. Weather is cool and cloudy. The squirrels around here were running very fast through the grass. They even chased some. I felt as if the squirrels were more aggressive in this part than in the other part. [this person writes squirrels like ‘squares’] Squirrels #1 and #4 interacted.\\n\\nSquirrels #8 and #9 very red.\\n\\nBird poop -----> A couple walked by to feed squirrel 7. Squirrel 6 would find a round object on the ground, like a nut, and tumbled/rolled around with it. Acorns on the ground in this partly shaded area but no squirrels and hardly any birds. Why? Oh, the parks worker using the leaf blower, raking, and mowing the grass. What sensible small would not stay away? “Good morning, sorry about all of the dust,“ from the parks worker – a female whose gender was before undetectable under her uniform, goggles, and face mask. Couple taking wedding photos near gazebo. Squirrel 7 I found because a family was staring at it. It was in a tree and just laying down. It then came down, approached me, went back up in the tree, then approached two little girls who were looking. Lots of robins here Squirrel #2 climbed a tree and looked at me like I was an idiot. I tapped my button as instructed and it seemed satisfied that I was on official business.\\n\\nTwo separate creepy dudes stared at me. I did not tap my button; I just skedaddled out of there, This area was slightly busy, however it was a great vibe. There were a good amount of squirrels running around and they were actually being friendly. I chased a few up a tree. I felt very alive and happy the whole time.

Someone walking their cat \\n\\nA gentleman asked me if I was surveying trees. I said \"no, squirrels.\" He responded with, \"I forgot there was a squirrel count happening!\" Squirrels #1 and #3 chased each other around the tree, then grew tired of that went back to foraging. Lots of digging and camping! Squirrel #3 found an acorn. Squirrel #4 had a mouth full of leaves (for a nest?) and was chased by Squirrel #3 for a short time. Then Squirrels #1 and #3 began chasing each other again. Two people took pictures/video. Bike rental + food carts + bus tours at edge \\nI feel in the way. Saw a nest in a tree almost overhanging CPS. --> And then one over the pond (waterfront property) Multiple leaf blowers. \\n\\nGot asked: \"Can I ask what you\\'re doing?\" by a girl in town from FL for a Bachelorette Weekend, killing time in Central Park waiting on others to arrive. I told her, gave her an acorn button, and thanked her for asking. \"Glad I did!\" she said. As I was leaving my hectare, took a photo of & for 2 tourists.\\n*peace signs* Even though I work on 60th and Lexington, I have never stopped here or knew who this statue was. A few tourists come by to view and take pictures of the statue. Saw a pack of runners stretching to warm up for a run in the park. You could smell the horses. Hear the traffic of cars, buses, taxis. Hot dog, waffle vendors. The Plaza Hotel/Condo was to the right of the statue. Saw this couple dressed in a beautiful ruffled yellow dress and blue suit. Very popular statue. \\n\\nNo sightings of squirrels. :(\\n\\nYinko Shonibare Wind Sculpture\\n\\nHorse and carriages We saw several squirrels all at the same time but we managed to document four. #NAME? This section is off the beaten path for the squirrels. However, tourist seem to love and feed them. Squirrels are real hams posing for the camera and are not shy about accepting treats (AKA nuts). It seems I hit the squirrel jackpot. I\\'m sure there are more! These are the creatures that graced my path. Really enjoyable. Hope to do it again. \\n5 in total! Just past the info kiosk is a funny London planetree with an enormous trunk base that suddenly gets very skinny. Lady dancing to \"Thriller\" on boombox. Dad teaching daughter to play volleyball.

HORSE + CART DRIVER: \\n\\n\"How many squirrels?\"\\n- He stopped the cart, with passengers in it, to ask. A little boy (age 4-5) started running and saying “Mom! A squirrel! A squirrel!“ and that is how I found the first squirrel. Started at the wrong arch. That is why time is so late. Squirrel #2 chased #1 off linden tree. \\nSquirrels #3, #4, and #5 found in tree canopy, assumed adult gray, assumed 100 feet above ground. \\nSquirrels #3 and #5 on pin oak tree, #4 on maybe a dawn redwood tree. \\nSquirrel #6 may be #4? Climbed up dawn redwood and ate. I watched an amazing game of chicken between a woman and a squirrel on a path -- the squirrel was busy eating what appeared to be an acorn and could have cared less that people were attempting to walk around it. The squirrel maintained its position mid path and the woman was forced to shimmy up against the temporary fence to get around. A true New Yorker, that squirrel. There\\'s a wedding happening at the Cop Cot Gazeebo.\\nBirds were super vocal by #2 \\nTons of blackbirds\\nBirds were causing berries?

Walked behind a couple\\'s  fancy photos while writing that last sentence, so squirrel census has now been professionally documented. The squirrels in this quadrant had widely varying tails -- #1 had a short stub where its tail should have been; #4 had a large fluffy tail with a large white puff at the end; and #5 also very puffy, though without the puff. (A distant relative?) The sanctuary is beautiful and peaceful. Many DOGS \\nSanctuary locked! \\n(opens at 10am)\\nMouse sighting!\\nReema from Bangladesh helped me find #3-4 Area was very dense with trees. Only saw 3 squirrels but much of area was not accessible. Suspect more squirrels in the hectare, out of sight. Visible squirrels were busy foraging for nuts and indifferent to human activity nearby. Possible other squirrels high in the trees, taking notes for 2018 Central Park Human Census. Area marked for Squirrels #1, #2, and #3 is not open for humans and should be a good number of squirrels on the ground. Three squirrels spotted running. Squirrels #2 chased #1 across grass and up Sophora tree. Pigeons eating near Squirrel #2, something startled them and they flew/ran away. Birds and pigeons were very active in this area. Busy area, with heavy car traffic and lots of dog and human traffic and a high level of birds (making tree spotting difficult). Squirrels in this hectare were some of the friendliest I’ve come across, approaching people + taking food from hands. The area was so beautiful, as we walked we both felt at ease and one with nature. The vibes were great and there weren\\'t too many squirrels but there were dogs and cats. We saw a dog that was so beautiful. She had grey fur. She was a rescue according to the owner, but she couldn\\'t identify the type of dog. A squirrel was chilling and foraging on the ground when it got into a confrontation with another squirrel. There were kuks exchanged but then they both ran away. - #2/#3 Juveniles playing / chasing each other running up tree \\n- Dogs still running around off leashes after 9 am \\n- #9: Dogs around + running from \\n\\n- #10 - relaxed eating Lots of acorns and chestnuts in this area!

It was mostly the same five squirrels foraging and eating in the grass. They didn’t pay any attention to people walking nor dogs nor the birds also looking for food in this area. They were more in the open grass by a single tree then in the bushes. The squirrels seem to be relaxed and hanging out by the rocks/boulders, where it was calmer. Mostly the hectare was pretty busy, lots of people on bikes, walking dogs, etc. Numerous unleashed dogs in park. Squirrels #1 through #4 being fed by tourists. There was a pretty obvious turf war happening in a tree. I heard it before I saw it. A scurry of claws on bark, a rustle of leaves and a shower of falling acorns. Squirrel (5) was obviously perturbed that squirrel (6) had found itself in his tree, and ran him right out of town. There was a brief exchange of \"words\" from tree to ground in what I can only imagine was language not meant for juvenile ears. Once I got into the area I didn\\'t notice any squirrels, so I climbed the Umpire Rock hoping to see around. Then I first noticed Squirrels #1 and #2. Jumping over each other. Very calm. No humans around. I would even say they were playing with each other. Then, immediately I see Squirrel #3 passing by and climbing a tree. I didn\\'t see this squirrel anymore. I walk around, then notice that for the entire time a dog has been observing squirrels #1 and #2 from the distance, sitting, not moving. Like a statue for the entire time. After 20 minutes or so, I hear the dog\\'s owners calling him but the dog won\\'t move. His name is Harper. I walk around, don\\'t notice more squirrels but then decide to come closer to squirrels #1 and #2. It\\'s no longer two but three squirrels I see so I register Squirrel #4, then start watching the trees. I see Squirrel #5, who joins the rest of the \"family.\" Squirrels #1, #2, #4, and #5 keep climbing up and down the tree next to the baseball fields for the rest of my time there. Around five to seven humans stop by and take photos of the gang. The squirrels are indifferent through all of this. Before my time ends, I walk around once more but notice no new squirrels. I took a photo of Harper the dog watching squirrels. I\\'ll send it to you. - Squirrels #1 and #2 intxn\\n* Someone drumming on top of Umpire Rock\\n- Squirrels #11 through #15 maybe a family?

A squirrel! Squirrels #1 and #2 were playing up and down tree. The lawns were being mowed in this hectare while I was observing. The lower right corner is occupied by a trainer throwing frisbees for his dog to catch! There are seriously a lot of barking dogs! \\n\\nSquirrel #2 was on a tree with those helicopter seeds. One inch worm found its way onto \\nthis counter\\'s shoulder. The waning\\nsun left the air cool and calm. The Victoria Gardens are now gone and will become skating rink again soon. Saw an acorn tree. Dogs playing and running in the lawn. Sounds of blue jays. People strolling as they as they are having their morning coffee. I can see horse and carriage ride on road. As you face the Victoria Gardens, you see all the tall NYC buildings. So quiet and peaceful. Citibank Bike riders. No squirrel sighting. :( Fire hydrant in the lawn. There was a tour that stopped (marked (T) on map). A (guide) person was talking to the group with a microphone. Guy walking by w/ a clanging, empty cart. At one point, a dog w/o a leash chased after squirrel #3 but it ran away up into a tree. A total of 3 dogs went after the squirrel unsuccessfully. There are at least 5 oaks in this area so acorns are in abundance. Multiple squirrels foraging and/or burying nuts. Wonder if they’ll remember locations. Largely in different humans; they have more important business afoot. \\n\\nWanted to report some squirrels on trees, but only saw tree squirrels after the data collection window passed. Sorry for lack of location diversity! - So many birds! I don\\'t know what they\\'re called, but the Snow White cheep cheep kind and they were all huddled together in a meadow.\\n- The one squirrel I saw was super active way high up in a tree. \\n- I hare the horse + carriages but loved that one was Not many people but noisy staff with leaf blowers. \\n\\nGot to see the seals being fed! And practice tricks!\\n\\n(Saw horses in barn (not in my hectare).) Very difficult to access,\\n\\nOver 50 percent inside of Zoo. Too many humans for squirrels. Too many humans lounging on the lawn, lots of kids. Music in the background. Squirrels staying above ground. As I sit writing this recap, a woman who was participating in the race is trying to balance a mobile phone on a rock to take a selfie -- a grey squirrel jumped up right next to her phone -- no Fear.  It wanted food. The woman annoyedly shooed it away. \\nMy hectare was mostly inaccessible, being comprised of a lot of the zoo which was \"authorized access only\" or not yet open. I was able to observe four squirrels in the densely wooded perimeter, having initially despaired of seeing any. 3 grays, 1 black. I also saw two squirrels just outside my area, in 4-I, I believe. The squirrels --> \\n--> I observed were focused on their tasks, primarily foraging. \\nI live in Stuyvesant Town, an area of Manhattan with an incredibly dense squirrel population. The squirrels in Stuy Townn are bold and fearless -- they want a nut and they want it now. They\\'ve become accustomed to being fed nuts by Stuy Town residents, primarily the elderly residents. Drop a nut, especially a premium one, such as a full walnut in its shell, and they will arrive en mass. The squirrels I saw today in Central Park, while they did not approach me, would not have needed much coaxing. You can \"turn\" a squirrel pretty quickly in this town. \\nBut enough about me...today was a fine day for a squirrel census and I very much appreciated this opportunity -- it was a very peaceful experience. Counting squirrels makes your troubles disappear into nature. \\nThanks! [drawing of squirrel] A family of tourists was very interested in Squirrel #1. Squirrel #1 was outside a hectare. Most of 4-H is the zoo, so no squirrels sighted. The Zoo was in my territory. I was very surprised that the WCS did not know about the Census. I had to speak to the head of security to gain access to the zoo.\\n\\nI think a nice thank you note to the WCS from your organization would be appropriate. Squirrel #1 foraging — ran across path, climbed shrub five feet, ran down and hid under bush. Squirrel #2 chasing Squirrel #3. Squirrel #3 was up at the highest branches, ripping off smaller twigs and returning them to its nest 30 feet up tree. Video taken. Always takes the same path to nest. Sometimes drops twig/leaf. Continued for 10+ minutes. I left area, still building.\\n\\nArea included busy Fifth Avenue — dogs and cars and path on western side had many people walking through.\\n\\nSquirrel #2 digging in ground, eating, very bushy tail, cross walking path without hesitation or addressing humans stopping to watch it, take pics up close. Most focused on digging, running back-and-forth across path. Video taken. After seeing only one squirrel in 10 minutes, I was suddenly hit on the head with nuts. Many people in the area, particularly because a run was taking place. Also, many dogs, including at least four off leash, were in the area.\\n\\nKept returning to the spot marked with asterisk (a lawn,) thinking at least one squirrel would be there, but found none.

Then a runner passed under the arch as a truck dropping off vending carts drives by the arch. More people and dogs east of the arch, including kids on break from school since it is Columbus Day. Women walking dogs by Ballfield #5, talking about “school shooting drills.“ Squirrel #1 – Heckscher Fields/nut stand. \\n\\nSquirrel #2 — in baseball field.\\n\\nTwo women approached the squirrel and took photos of it. S/he was not afraid, although it did run partially up a tree after but soon returned to the ground.\\n\\nAbout 100 yards away, the other squirrel almost looked like a rabbit from afar. Both squirrels were busy foraging. It was a pretty busy area full of pedestrians. Surprisingly litter free. - I said hi to squirrel #1 and she came to me! She climbed the fence and stared, probably waiting for me to give her food. - Squirrel #2 was running and climbing like crazy in a tree trying to get as much seeds as she could. She even hung from her hind pa Squirrel #10 fed by passersby. When I started observations there was a Red-Tailed Hawk hunting. It swooped down and tried to catch something. I didn\\'t see what it tried to catch. It left after about 15 minutes. It did not catch any bird or squirrel. \\nIt was only about 5 minutes after it left when I saw any squirrels. Someone asked me if I was an arborist.\\n\\nThere\\'s a couple sitting on the rock near the Carousel, making out. Afraid to walk over there. They looked at me and then continued!

A second squirrel up ahead in the trellis went running along its way. A third squirrel approached the first squirrel (and the food), but backed away from the first larger squirrel — there was no confrontation and all was soundless, including the human father and daughter. Squirrel #1 running along fence, then stopped to eat on fence. \\n\\nSquirrel #2 came down tree. \\n\\nSquirrel #3 on the ground. \\n\\nSquirrel #4 on rock outcropping. \\n\\nSquirrel #5 running up and down two trees. \\n\\nSquirrel #6 sitting on branch eating, very still. Hectare fenced out, walked around the fence perimeter. Lots of picnickers, families, couples and trios lounging under trees. Sports event on the side of meadow. No squirrels inside meadow. Can hear but not see seals barking on the Zoo side. This area is pretty quiet otherwise, because the Zoo is closed for the day. \\n\\nEast side of hectare is all street traffic. \\n\\nSquirrel #1 seemed threatened by my presence and stared me down for the whole time I was recording it. \\n\\nIn the space between the Arsenal 5th Avenue/64th Street is a tall tree with a plastic bag stuffed in a hole in the tree about 20 feet up — put there by animal? Area is loud and busy. Traffic, both people and motor traffic. Construction, people having dinner, horse-drawn carts, bicycle cabs. Sirens. Very noisy. Joggers.\\n\\nDad playing catch with his kids, with a football. Sweet. In each case the squirrels seemed less interested in humans than expected for Central Park squirrels, who are no beggars for human food. While voraciously foraging through the grass, barely a glance to see if I had a bite to offer. Also, I believe they know when dogs are leashed. Little fear of the leashed dog. An oddly silent bunch, given (or because of, perhaps) the constant symphony of the city. Squirrel # did such a wonderful job of safely crossing West Drive -- which is teeming with runners, walkers and bikers at this time. Mr #1 Squirrel seemed very comfortable in his skin (yes -- great anthropomorphising -- sorry) and with his surroundings. Squirrel #2 very interested in me. Took acorn I threw.\\n\\nSquirrels #4, #5, #6, #7 were playing together around tree base. A lot of people stopped to take pictures of the squirrels and they were completely unfazed. One actually came closer to me and then stood up o its hind legs.\\n\\nIt felt like there were way more squirrels out and about than in the morning. I saw a giant trash bag pile and hoped to see some squirrels there but no such luck. Their standards are much higher. So classy. I approached Squirrel #1 to make his acquaintance. He noticed my intrusion but did not show signs of distress, nor did he phone the neighborhood watch. Parking myself an acorn\\'s drop from his white belly, I stared up at his perch. We held a respectful gaze for about two hours*, he taking in my lowly figure and I paying reverence to his xylem throne. He then motioned to the Labradoodles to the west. I’m nodded. It was time for our revels to end. His agent has since contacted my team to authorize release of the footage.\\n\\n*45 seconds Squirrels #1, #2, #3 are family, I think! Squirrels #2 and #3 were popping their heads out of a hole in the tree. Squirrel #1 was on top of the hole.

They briefly met in tree, didn\\'t fight, one just went back down and ran off. Sheep Meadow closed Lovely lady took our group selfie pic… She was from Australia!\\n\\nMy hectare is just along the 68th St. cross-park \"highway“ and borders the Sheep Meadow, so it is at once both a quiet place where folks are sitting on blankets – talking, reading, relaxing – and where other folks are walking, strolling, biking cross-park on the paved path, so it’s also moderately busy. Saw a punk rocker getting pic taken in front of Columbus on Columbus Day. He X\\'d his arms over his head. \\n\\nSquirrels #1 and #2 look like they are playing tag. \\n\\nA horse whinnied!\\n\\nGood hideaway here. The squirrel was scared because there was a marathon and many dogs. But it was very friendly. 1 People taking pictures of engraved paving stones near Will Shakespeare \\n\\n2 Woman teaching children to bike \\n\\n3 Man doing push-ups near William Shakespeare Very busy\\n\\nA man asked if I was part of the Consensvency. I explained the census/and gave him some buttons. He said I made his day! We heard the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" from the start of the Columbus Day Parade while we were next to the statue of Columbus. There are manhole covers in the fields.\\n\\nThought there\\'d be more squirrels. People enjoyed watching the sea lions be fed from the periphery of the zoo. Many dogs were off-leash despite it being past 9 a.m. A family from what sounded like Georgia all ate hot dogs for breakfast and little kids were eating sno-cones at a very early hour. This map needs review. A path goes to the rock. \\nThis is a meadow. A proper meadow. Not just a lawn.\\n\"Native Meadow\"\\nStreet Performer\\n\\nThis is a major rock and should be named \"Sally\\'s Climbing Rock.\" Lots of tourists in the area and runners and cyclists. One cyclist chastised another, saying repeatedly, “That was very dangerous. Why would you do that.“ A family of tourists passed, with the apparent mom questioning, “What is the school of Juilliard?” And an older teen son responding obstinately, “I’m only interested in the history.“ Saw a rat or mouse @ 66th & 5th\\n(1) came down tree, foraging for food on rocks, looks very healthy \\nScared by a breeze!

Squirrel City! Tavern on the Green a great spot.\\n\\nMany near Adventure Playground. Sheep Meadow is closed this morning. But as a result, the field is so calm, pristine, and natural. The few squirrels that I did see seemed to know they had the space to themselves. They nibbled, they hopped, they nibbled, they dug, they hopped...with seemingly little care of the world outside the field. We saw three people taking pictures of Squirrel number three! It appeared to be posing. A kid threw a nut at it, and it grabbed it and ran a little way away to eat it. \\n\\nWe saw cool looking mushrooms. \\n\\nWe saw more people taking pictures. We were surprised! The area I was monitoring was mostly open field, bordered by a few London planetrees. There were no squirrels to be seen, and I speculated this might be because the trees do not provide sustenance for the squirrels. Suddenly, I saw one. It was thrashing around like a maniac, but it was kind of far away — visibility was poor. As I made a stealthy approach, the squirrel suddenly broke into two shapes and flew away! It was a couple of starlings in a death match or — it dawned on me — consummating an affair of the heart. No squirrels were seen, but I did begin the composition of my starling romance novel. Hectare fenced out. Lots of dog walkers. Large youth/school event in North Sheep Meadow. Group is “Playworks“-run event. Kickball sporting event. The Sheep Meadow was fenced in and closed off to the general public. All squirrels were in the fenced-in meadow. \\n\\nThe pathway and volleyball courts were busy with pedestrian traffic. \\n\\nLoud music being played by the volleyball courts. Squirrel #2 ate an acorn and observed me calmly. After about 3 minuted he/she climbed a tree about 3 feet high and perched upside down on the bark staring into space. Squirrel #3 was rapidly digging a hole. I didn’t spot any nuts. #NAME? Zero squirrels Lots of cyclists, little dogs, many tourists speaking different languages. Plus raven (?) calls. Faint construction in background. East Dr. not that busy, handful of joggers. Lots of people walking work. Lawnmower going by around 9:11 a.m. Squirrels #6 and #7 seems smaller but probably not juvenile. They were standing up on two legs a lot while eating. Squirrel #8 also seems smaller. Tour group showing the statues. Squirrel #9 scratching with hind leg. Some kids started chasing Squirrel #1. It ran up a tree. Kai smelled a squirrel up a tree.\\n\\nStopped to watch a bee gather nectar.\\n\\nFound half-eaten acorns. Squirrel leftovers.\\n\\nSquirrel party! Eight squirrels by a path. Woman taking photos. Two squirrels approached us, and Kai threw acorns to them that he collected. They were disinterested.\\n\\nKai threw an acorn and the squirrel jumped in the air and did a 180 while tucking is tail in! Across from the Balto Statue there is a big oak tree. Squirrels #6 and #7 were “playing,” “wrestling.” Then they stopped and threw acorns on our heads! The Mad Bombers. Can hear music from all the way over from bandshell. #NAME? * Construction of playground in process.

There was a brief confrontation (or so it appeared) between the mama squirrel & myself. I allowed her to cross in front of me and she went on her way. It\\'s quiet. Too quiet.\\n\\nSquirrels #3 and #4 tag and wrestling. Slightly large. \\n\\nSomeone left their purple Harry Potter glasses on the playground. Three possible squirrel nests on acorn tree on southern corner of Central Park West and 68th St. One possible nest on bigger acorn tree on the northern corner, and there’s lots more acorns on the ground near this tree. Acorn trees in the playground area only had one possible nest and not many acorns in playground. I think they must be swept away so the kids can play.\\n\\nArea is busy with people with their dogs and children. Lots of kids yelling, screaming as they play.\\n\\nFamily of squirrels in tree. Been staying 15 feet or more up in tree after seeing me. They are going through the acorn branches, eating acorns, and to their nest in this tree. Nest is about 30 feet above ground. Busy area. Road full of cyclists, walkers, runners, hot dog carts, moms with babies in strollers. Lots of people relaxing on benches. Cold today, people wearing jackets and scarves. Lots of parents and kids in Tots Playground. We were surprised that there were no squirrels on the east side of West Drive, even though there were oak trees and lots of acorns.\\n\\nWhere we saw Squirrels #1 through #7, a man came and threw nuts for a couple of minutes. Squirrels #1 and #2 are staying right outside a sprinkler. \\n\\nThere must be birdseed on the ground.

Engagement party/picnic.\\n\\nArea next to it is smaller lawn/ quiet grove. Oak tree. Seemed like a perfect spot for squirrels, but we didn’t see any. Not even in the trees. It is of this author\\'s opinion that no squirrel with half an acorn for brain would voluntarily live in the Mineral Springs Dog Park area. Perhaps due to redlining or other morally bankrupt housing policies, we may someday find a population forced to live here as the only option made available to them. The much more affluent Le Pain Quotidien district lies adjacent, in a stark – but all too familiar — juxtaposition of the privileged and the marginalized.

To the north of the hectare is someone playing disco music for some rollerskaters + rollerbladers who seem to be having an afternoon dance party\\n\\nFor squirrels 1 + 3 a mom w/ a young toddler was trying to lure the squirrels closer by tossing snacks at them\\n\\nSquirrels 5,6,7 were foraging + seemed to be playing together -- I was a little too far to hear if there were sounds\\n\\nOVER --> \\n\\nAs I\\'m leaving the hectare, \\nFreedom by Aretha Franklin \\nis playing - The drizzle \\nhas gotten stronger during \\nthe past 20 mis but \\nthe skate dance party is not\\nletting up Saw people playing volleyball. \\n\\nLots of dogs. Squirrel #1 is being photographed by 3 people while eating and watching calmly from a distance of about 4 feet. Squirrel #3 carried an acorn in his/her mouth several paces, dug a hole, and then buried it. Squirrel #7 made 5+ trips in a tree to gather leaves to build a nest. The nest currently looks to be about 1.5x1.5’ and made out of twigs and leaves. Squirrel #8 was eating an acorn in a tree, saw me, ran down onto the ground, and ran away. There is a loud concert! Rap. Nelly’s “Hot in Here” was playing, which is ironic because it’s cold. It’s for breast cancer. Many people wearing pink. Unfortunately, cannot walk on the grass. Trees are spread out, it’s not a very foresty. I don’t see any fruits or nuts on ground. Saw an owl! Just looking and resting on a big branch. May also be why I saw no squirrels. It was flying around the area. Spotted around 9:25 a.m. I saw two incredibly vibrant Blue Jays\\n\\nI\\'m seeing so few squirrels, feeling like a failure! \\nMet French tourists looking to rent bikes. \\n\\nIn 7-G, met two vendors asked it I was counting squirrels. They told me there were 7 squirrels that they feed & they sit on their tables. Tourists take photos, used to be 8. Hawk killed one. All named Charlie. Drums! Next hectare over.\\n\\nAt 4:33 p.m., a gale came through. It blew down a vendor stand. A poster from the stand (wood or metal) hit a person walking and knocked him down. Everyone walking stopped to help the vendor pick up all his posters. It\\'s hard to imagine squirrels out and about after that. * Relatively quiet within this hectare but noise from outside (construction, honking, people speaking) can be heard.\\n\\n* People biking, walking, and running along East Side Drive.\\n\\n* Construction vehicle on East Side Drive.\\n\\nAgain, no squirrels! :( :( Pretzel squirrel \\n3-legged dog walked past -- then he spotted squirrel for me! The squirrels were indifferent to me and the other humans, but not to each other. When squirrel #2 came near squirrel #1, squirrel #1 chased #2 all soundlessly. They resolved their differences and were later in the same area without dispute. \\nSimilarly when squirrel #5 climbed a tree #6 descended chasing #5. Once both were on the ground and apart from one another there was peace. \\nIt was a morning for chasing as a dog on a long leash chased an off-leash dog who got away by jumping a fence. Lots of construction near one corner of hectare (by gazebo, bottom left). Whole bunch in that one section! Must be a good foraging zone ... Pigeons Nest in elm on sidewalk between 68th and 69th. There are a bazillion birds in the beautiful trees in this hectare as the sounds of their chirping is magical!\\n\\nGentleman walking his dogs along CPW also threw a whole handful of birdseed into park along wall ... lots of bird action!\\n\\nLarge area sectioned off from any kind of traffic; I assume for reseeding or just plain \"rest\" as it is almost completely devoid of grass or other vegetation besides the nine glorious trees ...\\n\\nYup! Just saw the sign: \"Lawn Closed for Renovation\" 5k going by\\nlots of dogs\\ngetting much busier with\\npeople and dogs One squirrel, #8, was almost silver in color — something I haven’t previously seen.

(heart)\\n\\nSquirrels #2 and #3 were playing with each other. \\n\\nPeople dress really nicely for lawn bowling.\\n\\nYES, HULA-HOOP DANCE PRACTICE!\\n\\nUpdate: Oh no, someone appears to not be as committed to the routine. This area needs 60-90 minutes --> 35-40 huge trees. Too many dogs! More than nine. Many oak trees and acorns. Wonderful talk with woman walking dog — from Upper West side, went to Princeton University — discussed “orange“ squirrels, Ellie Kemper\\'s new book. Tree trimming! * loud drumming music/outdoor concert nearby\\n* Acorns fell off trees, almost hit me in the head! :)\\n* Tricky to walk through — lots of fence poles blocking walkway. Super loud drummers near Beethoven! \\n\\nOlder woman talked to me as I was recording squirrel #1 -- said she always carries peanuts in her pocket so she can stop by + feed her squirrel friend \"Chiquita\" every day! She called its name + it stood up straight + ran over to her, got its nut, + ran away. She said she knows it\\'s illegal to feed them but does it anyway. :) A ballerina danced on a stage off the Mall while a photographer (and many Instagrammers) snapped shots. Later, a man sat on a park bench and played saxophone. There was a HUGE fun run kicking off right as I was counting. Met this man who had an aggressive dog harass him.\\n\\nFinally saw some left of Strawberry Fields making aggressive noises, one chasing the other. One big tree with lots of sounds coming from it. I’m not sure if it was a squirrel or bird. Lots of kids and dogs around here. — Northeast side of hectare is roped off by security barricade for Central Park summer stage — can’t get close. \\n— The southwest area is off limits for walking to protect American Elm. \\n— On Northside of hectare, hear a man singing + hyping the crowd. \\n— On Southside, hear solo jazz drumming. \\n— Squirrels #1 and 2 spotted right next to each other - foraging together. \\nOVER —> \\n— 5:42 - Hear “Circle of  Life: being played on summer stage \\n— #3 squirrel emerged from small cluster of wild flowers approximately 3 ft away from me, and ran to climb a nearby tree \\n— There are 3 ppl laying out on the top of the large rock shelf \\n— About a dozen other sitting on the northside of the rock shelf to watch concert — #5 squirrel ran away as a man entered the lawn area near it, but returned to original position once man was 10 ft away \\n— By the end of this observation it was close to dusk + getting dark Some kids attempting to catch a squirrel by hitting the tree with a very tall stick. They were unsuccessful. Twice I\\'ve seen a guy jogging and kicking a pink soccer ball along the curb. He seems like a good guy. I saw a couple taking their wedding photos but the man was much older, so I was staring super-hard trying to find out the dynamic, and so they stared at me, and then they walked past me, and he wasn\\'t that old — he was just balding. Far enough from the concert at the bandstand to see squirrels! The movement of small birds suddenly makes 6&7 go on a tree, but they returned to the ground a sec later to continue foraging. Seriously, loads of small birds. Hula-hoop woman.\\n\\nWoman posing for photo by boyfriend. She is laying flat on her back, arms spread melodramatically. She checks the pic, has him take another. * lots of tourists, singing groups and people out \\n* The woman selling pictures next to strawberry field said the squirrels here run up + down the trees all day gathering nuts, and acorns constantly fall on her head! couple sitting on bench \\nfamily with baby carriage \\nTourist walking around \\nstrawberry field with Guide \\ncar near (?) car traffic near \\nroad \\nDog walking \\nRed Robbins hopping around At first we were getting somewhat discouraged, given the running race and the large number of dogs in the hectare. But then, we saw her. She darted out of the bushes right in front of us and scampered up a very tall tree. When we looked up, we saw that she was with a juvenile high in the top of the tree. So many dogs unleashed!\\n\\nLots of runners (people)! Last three squirrels were in the same area and seemed to keep their distance from each other. When they got close to each other they ran in circles around each other, they ran and circled around each other. They stood apart and one held his tail straight up and moved it left to right a little (maybe meaning, \"I don’t want to fight\") and then they separated. There was some loud singing at Strawberry Fields from a Christian band that had been at the Beacon I was told by a friend. Fancy black standard poodle is stalking a squirrel. hides behind tree, rather than run up tree. \\nSquirrel holds nut in its mouth, twitches tail. \\n\\n- Near Falconer statue there are no people + no squirrels in rocky area. \\n\\nSquirrels all near paths w/ people in the area \\n\\nSometimes I would throw an acorn for the squirrels, and half the time they\\'d eat it. Heavy pedestrian traffic.\\n\\nMusic playing.\\n\\nLots of birds and nests. I am cold. (1) Walking tour group\\n(2) Cyclist who had a whistle in her mouth and blew it when people were in her way\\n(3) Squirrel 5 was like an acrobat, hanging onto a branch by its legs upside down. \\nIt would pull leaves off, eat them, then toss whatever it couldn\\'t eat onto the ground \\n(4) Squirrel 5 and 4 chased each other through trees It’s lucky that I found my first squirrel just when I started to count. However, that’s also the last squirrel I found in this hectare. The squirrels seem to prefer to staying in their hives, for I found many holes in the trees without squirrels showing up. Instead, the birds are active. And I found one red breast (seems to be) which I saw not from television for the first time. Area near flagpole calm but loud music and large crowd nearby. Parts of hectare were calm, but they were sandwiched between a drum concert and a pop-up roller disco (competing noise), so it all felt busy. I didn’t want to be there. I don’t blame the squirrels for not wanting to be there either. Squirrels were being very noisy in the area, but few were seen.\\n\\nThere was one black squirrel sighted though — foraging, jumping more than others I’d seen.\\n\\nNearby (Hector 9-E), park was doing tree trimming, which may have impact the population.

Five stars.\\n\\nSadly, nary a squirrel to be seen. Very heavy foot traffic. Squirrels maybe don\\'t like John Lennon tunes? A squirrel nest sat high on the top floor of a prime real estate tree, but no squirrels to be seen. I turned, then suddenly saw him — an older gray squirrel, long time Upper West Sider, it seems. As we spotted squirrels 1 and 2, a mama and baby who chased and grooved and nuzzled around a tree, a wedding was unfolding beneath a nearby gazebo. Quietly, we snuck a long the outskirts of the gathered crowd. Once again, we were quiet interlopers as we spotted squirrels 4 and 5. Women in complicated scrappy black lingerie, giant feathered and horned headdresses, and shiny satin robes posed for a photo shoot while the squirrels snacked. This bench is for Emma, the good dog.\\n\\nI thought that squirrel and I had a bond. I was just next to its drinking fountain. A man was selling ponchos at the Bethesda \\nFountain & singing, \"Did you save your money for\\na rainy day? That\\'s what my grandmother used\\nto say.\" The area around the front of Bethesda Fountain was very busy. A busker was playing guitar and singing with an amp at the fountain, a couple was having an argument about a stolen credit card PIN while lounging on a blanket near Squirrel #5. All of these squirrels were snacking and looked like they had been for some time — they were Rubenesque! All of the squirrels seemed unperturbed by nearby humans – all have acorns in hand, happily munching unnoticed by humanity. Squirrels #1 through #4 kept themselves evenly spaced and equidistant – sharing the little knoll. Lots of tourists and tour groups. \\nThere was a 5k going on through the road. A large wedding party in navy and cream colors is taking up an entire set of steps. When I eventually walked up the steps past where they have been posing, I noticed it smelled strongly of urine. No squirrels. Too busy a spot most likely, but damn maybe they think the smell is gross, too.\\n\\nAcross the road, a loud percussion band is playing.\\n\\nBack on the Bethesda Fountain side, I finally see squirrels! One from quite a distance from where I just was.\\n\\nOK. Done. Lots of people making out in quiet spaces think I’m a creeper now. Today is the squirrel sighter got caught in some thorns — worth it, though. Found a squirrel!\\n\\nBreezy and calm autumn morning with lots of joggers passing by. Rumsey Playfield being broken down for the off-season. Squirrels stayed pretty close to the woody area. Had to go into the woods to spot first. Squirrel foraged and watched me cautiously. Kept scratching itself with its leg. Two squirrels but possibly one squirrel that covered ground quickly. Lots of runners and horses and buggies. Woman, exhausted from her jog, asked me for the time. (9:04 a.m.) Horse-drawn carriage sighting. Homeless man camped out with the Pilgrim and all his belongings. Hot dog vendor, not too busy just yet. Squirrel #1 hopping with nut in his mouth.\\n\\nSquirrel #2 hopped down from tree.\\n\\nSquirrel #3 digging holes and planting nuts and eating.\\n\\nSquirrel #4 climbing a tree and on ground. The tree variety in this hectare was unusually diverse. After a careful study, I’ve conducted that cinnamon colored squirrels with white highlights are the prettiest looking squirrels. The Waldo Hutchins Bench has a sundial and squirrel stonework on its side. - Terribly calm rat spotted in the brush near the playground. Did not even look up when a spaniel flushed a dozen sparrows near its bench.\\n\\n- Yet another rat across from the info kiosk.\\n\\n- THIRD RAT BY MORSE STATUE\\n\\n- FOURTH RAT BY 72ND\\n\\n- THIS IS FAR TOO - Three squirrels come out looking for food at the same time but different trees.\\n\\n- Squirrels #4 through #6 come out to find food together.\\n\\n- Squirrel #7 is burying its food.\\n\\n* A mouse runs randomly to find its food left in the playground. A rat came toward me but then ran away when I tried to take her portrait.\\n\\nOhh, that bird is so yellow!\\n\\nRat taking garbage from bags as her rightful due, the rat tax.\\n\\n Shiny rock!\\n\\nAbsolute unit of a golden retriever\\n\\nThe Unceded Rat Lands extend from the gully of the trash station through the thick undergrowth up to the Rustic Overlook (\"a space for truth, serenity, and transition, 2001\"). Squirrels watch from the opposite bank, unwary. On the Rustic Overlook, two old men smoke weed and talk about their health, also unwary. Stopped by a man wanting to know if I was counting squirrels — he suggested I go to the Ramble. That’s where he feeds squirrels and bluejays every day. Lovely rainy morning \\nThere appear to be no squirrels on the lake\\'s island \\nThe island is approximately 20 feet from the ramble\\'s shoreline. It appears to be roughly 800 square feet. A family of squirrels \"could\" live there, quite happily, but would most likely begin to feel isolated. Some would turn on each other, while others would begin to build boats. Heard quaas but couldn\\'t find the source! \\n(coming from the trees)\\nSun was low, getting darker, few squirrels visible! \\nOne squirrel (#2) seemed to be chewing on a piece of bark while sitting on a branch on a tree and it was making a grinding sound (perhaps grinding his teeth down?) There are a ton of dogs and people, some off leash, some with leashes on. Some of these hunting dogs would easily catch and kill squirrels. This area is also littered with acorns. Well, I finally saw one on my way out. It was on that large green lawn where dog owners let their dogs loose — one squirrel going from tree to tree. I don’t think they like getting wet. So the squirrels here are lazy today or scared. There’s a cluster of people taking pictures and congregating on Bow Bridge. There are several off-leash dogs (around eight( in the area, some yapping.\\n\\nThere’s a cluster of trees (indicated on map) that have a collection of acorns under them. Looked carefully into these trees – one had a nests (maybe squirrel nest) but no squirrels in view or heard anywhere. Lots of bird calls (small birds) and one call that sounded like from a larger bird (not in view). Necktie draped over park bench. Someone ditched their day job. While brides took their photos at Bethesda Fountain, a young squirrel peeked its head up to see what all the fuss was about while the elder squirrel lounged upside down, hanging by its feet, on the side of a tree. We had a nice conversation w/ a couple who asked us if we were with the squirrel census. They asked us a few questions, which we answered to the best of our ability. \\n\\nThey thanked us for taking time to count the squirrels. Dog frightened squirrel. Less birds. Less people! By loud fountain area but weirdly quiet. Squirrel was comfortable. I felt as though it was playing hide and seek with me. Found a dollar Shortly after off leash hours ended, the squirrels started emerging from their hiding spots. One \"early bird\" squirrel was treed by two hounds. Squirrels #1 and #2 playing in tree near picnic house. Squirrel #3 on ground near bushes. Cat bird on tree near. Green lawn with a lot of starlings and squirrels west of 12-G. Additional squirrels outside area. Squirrel dray 40 to 50 feet above ground. Hard to see characteristics of squirrels above ground due to bad light. Many people in this area, 100+, dogs 30+, small children, bikers. Kind of noisy because of dog Barks. Dogs running around catching balls. Bird sounds. I paid close attention to the bushes and tall trees further in the grass area. No signs of squirrels either. Squirrels #1, #2, #3, a lot of activity, people and birds. Lady feeding them nuts. Birds include blue jays, sparrows. Squirrel #4 eating mushrooms. Squirrel drays above Squirrel #4 in tree, 40 feet above ground. Tree full of sparrows in big round tree. Indigo called it the arguing tree. People picnicking. Heard planes overhead. Met a group of students visiting from Mexico. Traffic on 5th Avenue. Saw two more squirrels\\' nests high up in trees. Dog carrying a tree branch. Very gray cold wet day. - Saw a nice pair of socks hanging in a bush, but they weren\\'t my size. \\n\\n- No squirrel activity at all.\\n\\n- Lots of nuts and berries on the ground.\\n\\n- Hectare encloses large mowed lawn. Dog scared me by suddenly chasing something while I was looking up in trees\\nMay have been a squirrel \\n\\nSo very busy Many dogs still off leash after 9 AM. On behalf of the squirrels, I am offended.\\n\\nTurns out, the hotdog cards use huge chunks of dry ice. Big brick of one wrapped in Kraft paper and twine, smoking. This area was very busy, with bike, foot, and force traffic – despite numerous nut-bearing trees, only squirrel (#1) was observed in the open.\\n\\nTowards the end of the survey period, a hawk (seemingly stooping from the campanile of the San Remo) circled the area — two squirrels (#3 and #4) I was observing in the brush bolted, although they gave no alarm call. A little boy got off of his scooter right at the incline, leading to scooter sliding away. Fortunately I caught it before it got too far! High-traffic area — lots of runners — garbage trucks, cars.\\n\\nLots of great trees — can\\'t believe I didn\\'t see any squirrels!\\n\\nCloudy weather — maybe they are sleeping in with their Nutella bars. [CROSSED OUT]\\n3 People filming cardinal on iPads\\nIf you know it takes longer, you know it takes longer\\nI mean I can pay it. I was just sort of mystified. \\nSquirrel breaks into my apartment. \\n\\n[NOT CROSSED OUT]\\nA guy with a big white mustache & binoculars told me that a squirrel broke into his house. And, in another instance, a raccoon. Later, talking to Nate, I understand this is a story he often tells to squirrel counters. This very narrow, bramblous strip of land produced a surprising quantity of squirrels -- I observed one very tentatively nibble on some fungus sprouting from a fallen, rotted log. \\nSquirrel (5) was observed rooting up a cache of acorns and consuming one. \\n\\n[\"Bug sacrificed in the name of science\" w/ arrow drawn pointing to a smear on the page] Someone asked me what I was doing, so I told them squirrel survey. And she replied, \"I heard about this. I don\\'t get it.\" A squirrel stood on a rock and he ate some grass Not many people in the actual Ramble. \\n\\nSaw a cat on a leash! Squirrel #1 up in tree. An older couple passed and the woman asked me if I was counting squirrels. She pointed me toward where she had just seen one --> in the Ramble. The man said he thought it was just one squirrel running around. I told him I said that...but about the chipmunk. Pointed some tourists toward Belvedere Castle using my Area Map. I lost track of a squirrel while helping them. Several nests where I found Squirrels #1 through #7. High up in the birch trees. Where I found Squirrels #8 through #11 there was lots of foraging by both squirrels and birds on the ground plane. Very active area. Squirrel #1 approached me to see if I had food. When he found me lacking, he went back to digging in leaves.\\n\\nSquirrels #4 and #5 were nearby one another and chased each other up and down a tree and finally across the branches. Not many people eating at the Boathouse at start.\\n\\nSquirrel #1: Climbed upwards, transitioning between many small branches. Very quiet. \\n\\nSquirrel #2: Walking around on ground floor, periodically digging. Also quiet.\\n\\nSquirrel #3: Just a five-second sighting! Dog barks in distance starting around 9 a.m.\\n\\nSquirrel #4: Probably a repeat of #2, still foraging on the ground.\\n\\nGetting bit by flies in this area. Lots of foot trafficnear Boathouse, but no squirrel sightings around there. Lots of blue birds / small birds / dogs \\nBad sax-phone playing under arch. No squirrels; lots of acorns. Worried (underlined) Met a sweet old lady w/ a cute dog; was down for the cause. I was shocked not to find a single squirrel foraging in the outdoor cafe. The robins and starlings were eating like kings on dinner crumbs. Two women from Amsterdam with bikes admire squirrels (“so cute!“) and ask for directions to fountain (Bethesda). A bluejay! Correction: many bluejays! (at least two)\\nDogs abundant off leash\\nTwo tour groups passed Found squirrels especially behind boathouse. Used a tested squirrel call to attract and some approached me getting very close expecting that I had something to feed them. I was sorry to disappoint them. Rainy, cold day. People are still out walking and ponchos or rain wear. Ducks on the Conservatory water. Saw a squirrel\\'s nest in a tree next to Le Pain Quotidien. Sounds of bluejays calling. Trees have not yet changed colors. No squirrels in sight. :(  Fifth Avenue traffic. Small birds climbing trees in the area \\nObserved a squirrel in greenery on the ground  looking like he was burying something buy he was flailing his arms our - when he noticed us watching he quickly ran to a nearby tree and stopped what he was doing “I don’t know what that is, but don’t be afraid of it.“ – owner\\'s wisdom to dog\\n\\n“Good boy! Great job! You can do it, you’re doing great. I’M doing great.“ – owner coaching dog on running, I think \"Are you counting the squirrel?\" a woman asked me from behind. I turned to see a mother with her son, he had a fishing pole and a net as big as his torso (filled with litter, although I couldn\\'t tell if it was theirs or collected). \\n\\n\"I am,\" I replied, and she went on to tell her son she had read about us. She asked for more, so I explained how I am walking the park, counting and documenting, categorizing and observing the squirrels. \\n\\nShe told her son, \"I was thinking this could be something fun for us to try.\" \\n\\nOTHER SIDE \\n\\nI told him it is fun, if you like animals or nature. \\n\\nHe thought for a moment, incredulous, and asked, \"Will they ever do a TURTLE census? OR CARP? I would definitely count carp.\"\\n\\nHis fishing pole bobbed away with his mother, still talking about the fish he could count. Area is extremely busy w/ 2 tour groups at 9 am. Lots and lots of activity with runner + walker + people w/ dogs. Everywhere. Large dogs off leash running wild. #3 lady with black dog off leash. Scared it away. Went up a tree 50-60 high and started jumping from highest branch to highest branch Stumbled upon a wedding ceremony happening by the lake.\\n\\nSaw some rats in this section. I saw a lot of birds but no squirrels. :( Saw man calling squirrel successfully. My legs have never hurt more. I am in pain. Cannot focus on squirrels. extremely enthusiastic scavenge hunting afoot \\nvery good german shepherd swimming/romping in rivulet (1) Cloudy left eye \\nmost were foraging and eating \\n(16) climbed on structure As we entered the hectare, we were met by Sheryl (the squirrel). Sheryl was handing out with her brother, Harold. The two of them (#2 and 3 on the map) foraged together and found many delicious nuts. Eventually, feeling full, Sheryl let out a kuk and she and Harold scurried off back to their cozy squirrel home. - Got identified as a squirrel spotter! * Squirrels #8 and #9 were chasing; #9 chasing #8.\\n\\n* Squirrel #14 was chasing itself, all alone, in the forest.\\n\\n* Squirrels and #17 and #18 were snacking on a rock by where the creek flows into the pond.\\n\\n* The activities of navigating a maze-like path system with a paper map and observing squirrels makes my brain work in a way that feels good to me. I feel refreshed and present with what is happening right now.\\n\\n* Took 40 minutes to walk through hectare. Nothing of note here. The two pairs of squirrels did some chasing of one another, but that was pretty much the only notable thing I saw. I saw and heard many birds.\\n\\nSaw five squirrels together, foraging, at the last minute. Chasing as well. Squirrels #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 approached me when I made squirrel noise I learned growing up in rural area. The area was very hilly and wooded with many side paths that I didn’t have time to explore. Two mounted PEP officers passed by on East Drive, surrounded by a cluster of gawking CitiBikers. Many people taking pictures at Alice in Wonderland. More kids than adults. Quieter, less dogs. Many dogs off leash running on the large grassy area. But some very cute dogs in raincoats! More foliage on eastern side of the path. I saw Squirrel #3 twice but was sure it was the same squirrel. Lots of small humans climbing on the statue, and squeaky sounds when they clamber on it. \\n\\nPlenty of birds chirping, and a falcon or hawk swooped by, fairly close to the tree canopy. Little clusters of people stretching or doing Tai-chi, posing for family portraits, or eating bagels and cream cheese on the benches. \\n\\nAny time I saw movement — a falling cluster of leaves, birds on the ground — I hoped it was a squirrel! Finally, it was! Squirrel was up in the tree eating and dropping things to the ground. In observing the many activities, a juvenile squirrel was high on the tree and resumed to go inside its home. We also saw a blue jay in the cardinal. We saw very weird trees and plants. We collected a lot of acorns to give to the squirrels. Overall we had a great time counting all the squirrels. crying children\\ndogs that look like old men\\ngolf cart?\\n\\nComicon (?) attendees appearing to pose w/ a taxidermied fox (?) -- some sort of ritual / photoshoot Squirrel #1 foraging.

Large concentration near the “Triplets Bridge” where there’s a dip in terrain near creek. (quiet) #3 here was so happy + content munching on his breakfast acorn!! - Busy hectare - Squirrel nest - Lots! - Amusing squirrel community! Squirrels #2 and #3 were foraging in a narrow strip between the road + a footpath as the Breast Cancer Walk went by -- both were mostly indifferent to all the people passing by.

Or, birdwatchers?\\nGuy was imitating a bird call so well! No squirrels in the area though. An older woman was taking pictures (with a real camera!) of a statue as I went past her -- She told me that she\\'s been walking the same path every day for years + had never noticed the statue until today! She said \"isn\\'t it amazing to see something for the first time?\" <3 \\n\\n\"Is it the standard \\'History of Armenia\\' that everyone [underlined] reads?\" - overheard \\n\\n[\"Big golden retriever playing fetch (named Mel!)\"] less dogs joggers & cyclists \\npretty quiet \\nsomeone reading \\n(3) chasing (4) I never noticed the sculpture of a hunting wild cat before so I’m glad I was assigned this area! Behind it is densely wooded. Near it I came across a rotted log with some pretty cool round white mushrooms – somewhat marshmallow-esque. I also found a spot where a lot of people apparently come to take a shit. There was much poop-streaked toilet paper here. Squirrels spotted back here were indifferent to it! The green space is pretty empty but the sidewalks/roads have a few people with dogs. The squirrels seem to be chasing each other through the shade. Sunny patches of dried leaves, seemingly not noticing people and dogs. And when they do, they freeze where they are. \\n\\nOne squirrel kept rubbing its face after digging. If was a human would spread lotion on her face. Then continued to bite its back like a grooming cat. Saw kids hunting for dinosaur bones and a couple arguing about whether Bill Pullman is dead or alive at a bench donated in his honor.\\n\\nSoccer game going on (a small one) right in the middle of the hectare. \\n\\nBig poodle playing in top right corner.\\n\\nMore dogs and kids playing than in other hectares I\\'ve visited so far. A dog got very upset when his tennis ball was thrown into a bush.\\n\\nLittle boys in suits riding scooters. This hectare was loud — full of kids! But the squirrels seemed mostly unconcerned. \\n\\nAnd, Squirrel #5 came right towards me — I think if I hadn\\'t backed up a bit, it would have come right to me feet. It sat up on its hind legs and looked right at me. Blue jays making a huge racket just west of my hectare. Surely they must be warning of a hawk. Thought for sure I wouldn’t see him squirrels with their alarms but soon as I started found Squirrels #1 and #2 chasing each other up and down trunk of oak tree. Squirrel #1 stopped, and Squirrel #2 continued up and out of sight. Squirrel #1 either stopped to watch me or the blue jays behind me alerted him. A couple of short quaas and then sudden stillness. I moved before it did. The squirrel stood like he was park kangaroo..poised to punch. I was still while he approached. He was the Mike Tyson of hectare 15-I. - the 5th squirrel is finding places to hide its food. It\\'s burying its nut and looks at human for a while to make sure its food is safe. Squirrel number one ran from tree to tree and around the playground (empty at the time).\\n\\nLoud hectare!

This path is calm, but the roads around it have a lot of carriages horses and strollers and bicycles. The squirrels don’t seem to be paying any attention to that — they’re just chasing each other around! - Row of cops just sitting along the side of a stone wall (6).\\n\\n- Lots of acorns lining the road\\n\\n- Passed a guy being filmed who had what looked like a pig-nose attachment\\n\\n- Upon further inspection, cops parked a string of motorcycles by Alexander on Hu Parks cleaning people driving and drinking coffee at the same time. His driving was quite skilled! \\n\\nFinally on my way out I met a couple from South Africa and they showed me pictures of all kinds of elephants and cheetahs and his girlfriend, and he was here entering a fishing competition in Alabama.\\n\\nLots of tourists climbing the rock. Saw a family photo shoot with a little dog named Queenie, as well as some ducks, but hardly any squirrels! If I was a squirrel I\\'d be asleep in my nest right now, for sure. Squirrel #2 was difficult to record — I spotted it on the ground, then marked its location. When I looked back for fur color, it was already up a tree 10 feet away. When I looked back again, it had climbed across the upper branches and was descending a different tree, 15 more feet away. Much quieter — time of day? One adult grey squirrel found a whole piece of toast. Some babies walked toward him; unclear if they wanted the squirrel or the toast. \\n\\nI saw the most beautiful Bluejay. \\n\\na woman stopped me + thanked me for doing the \"squirrel count.\" Lots of dogs in the meadow might have kept the squirrels hiding on that side of the hectare. This hectare is just inside one of the west side entrances by the Ramble, so it’s both touristy and fairly heavily wooded except for the meadow. Lots of traffic, but still quiet. People generally keep to the path. A mini cop car just passed, but it’s quiet too. I don’t see a dog just now, but the smell of dog shit suggests it was here pretty recently. A woman is painting a number of different kinds of leaves, but I can’t yet discern the overall composition of the peace. It’s the busiest thing in the hectare. This area was more fun, and had more squirrels -- especially off-path where there weren\\'t many people / dogs. \\n\\nSaw a lot of mushrooms too! Such a quiet hectare! Only saw a few people and only one dog — very few squirrels, lots of birds chirping. The Ramble brings to mind \"Law & Order,\" and it got borderline creepy back here when a guy sitting on a bench started singing opera ... * Squirrels #8 and #9 were fighting for a good five minutes.\\n\\n* Couple picnicking in meadow. Many of the squirrels were not afraid of us. In fact, when they realized we were not going to give them a treat, they \"scoffed\" at us. Typical panhandlers!! :) The two juvenile squirrels, #1 and #2, were sticking together – staying within 10 feet or 15 feet of each other. Every once in a while they would run at each other and hop around.\\n\\n16-E is the squirrel party, for real. It’s also where youths go to smoke the devil\\'s lettuce, so, pretty hopping spot. Took a while to cover because lots of squirrel activity. Mostly in wooded area and not on paths. Dead raccoon in woods. Squirrels #4 and #6 could be the same squirrel. Spotted two squirrels foraging in close proximity, but one split when it saw me. Later spotted the same two chasing each other.\\n\\nIntense cyclist on East Drive shouting \"Look out!\" disrupts the running.\\n\\nGroup of tourists on bikes unsure where to go. Squirrels #2 and #3 in same tree.\\nSquirrel #5 ran across the street. Squirrel #1 observed foraging.\\n\\nAlso observed: large groups on bicycles; Citibike struggle is real. \\n\\nKids playing organize soccer (coach dad with a whistle – liberal use of whistle). \\n\\nSeveral couples who is sorely wished I wasn’t stalking around the rocks and cedars. DOGS \\nPeople (large group) on grass \\nChildren on rocks\\nSquirrel #3 approached a man doing Tai Chi. \\nThe man put his hand down and began to walk. \\nThe squirrel followed him step by step across the arch. Then the man gave him a treat. Only saw one squirrel curiously foraging until a tiny yipping dog chased it into a tree poor thing Dead Bird\\ndogs on leash \\nchildren playing Juvenile squirrel in a small hollow nest about a foot up in a tree. Hole was just big enough for squirrel\\'s head. He was curious but afraid -- He could twist inside the hollow & would pull inside & then dart his head out to view me in 360 directions. Adult squirrel watched closely, clinging to a branch higher in the tree. Fancy European girls in their early 20s having a legit tea party in a meadow to celebrate one\\'s bachelorette. \\n\\nHomeless person sleeping on a bench. People eating really good-smelling burritos. \\n\\nSquirrel #2 was spotted just as I was feeling exasperated having not seen many — looked very majestic sitting there in a tree on a pedestal formed by a lopped-off branch, eating a nut. 8:51 a.m. — I\\'m in house finch territory.\\n\\n8:53 a.m. — I stepped on a gingko berry. Everything smells of vomit.\\n\\n8:53 a.m. — Dogs chase after ball. \\n\\n8:55 a.m. — I climb on a rock and look out for squirrels. I see no squirrels. \\n\\n8:58 a.m. — The road through Central Park is loud with automobiles. \\n\\n9:00 a.m. — Success, a foraging squirrel! \\n\\n9:03 a.m. — A hidden passage leads to the through-road.\\n\\n9:05 a.m. — The wind has picked up.\\n\\n9:06 a.m. — A condom wrapper. No, a lube wrapper — lube comes in wrappers?\\n\\n9:07 a.m. — A pigen follows me — ally or enemy? \\n\\n9:10 a.m. — Gray bird with mohawk and orange belly — small. \\n\\n9:11 a.m. — A twig breaks below my steps — my cover is blown. \\n\\n9:12 a.m. — The treetops only hold squirrel secrets. \\n\\n9:13 a.m. — Acorns assail me from above (no joke) — but no squirrels in sight. The woman whose (coincidentally also black) dog was angering the black squirrel told me Stuytown only has black squirrels! The third squirrel I saw was high in an oak tree; he was jumping around, knocking or throwing down acorns. No squirrels! Hundreds of Birds \\nNo dogs in the ramble, few dogs in Shakespeare Garden. A bride and wedding party were posing for photos in Shakespeare Garden.\\n\\nFamily speaking Hebrew near Swedish Cottage – my people!\\n\\nThought I heard kuks, but it was just someone wheeling a bike behind me. \\n\\nFamily playing hide and seek with a redheaded three-year-old at Stover’s Bench. \\n\\nSomeone was certain that all the money Clear (the airport security firm) makes goes to paying employees to harass people to sign up for Clear. It was a quiet morning in Hectare 17-D. There were plenty of dogs off leashes, but minimal to no interaction between dogs and squirrels. No squirrels by the castle this afternoon, but I did stumble upon a secret wedding! A couple were getting married just outside the castle with a couple of friends as visitors. There was a black cat near the Turtle Pond. Since some parts of the assigned area were blocked off due to the renovation of Belvedere Castle, I couldn\\'t cover some parts. Also, there are buildings in the areas. Scampering with branch on fenced shore of Turtle Pond. The path was very calm and devoid of human activity, likely due to the closure of the sidewalk for construction on to Belvedere Castle.\\n\\nAlso, I believe the two squirrels and I spotted were brothers but I have no data to back this claim up. The squirrels must be itchy today; I saw them scratching. A bird watcher approaches me. \"You\\'re not still counting squirrels are you?\" She rapid fire starts interrogating me about recently chopped down under brush and squirrel numbers & when the final report is due. She spots a few squirrels for me and leaves with a smile. Lots of foot traffic, lady was taking photos of flowers This seems to be a hectare of dogs, not squirrels. I passed 20+ large breed canines (labradors, great danes, german shepherds, mutts) at a seemingly pre-arranged playdate on the north side of the traverse. On the south side, there was another large group of dogs, although most were small terriers. Risky business to be a squirrel here, I think. (1) just hanging out, digging around. (2) ran when they saw me — leaped directly over my head from an elm into a holly tree (seriously) (3) + (4) spotted near (2), but not “with” — these guys ran up and down a trunk to the delight of passerby — all beneath the lower branches of the holly tree / bush thing Possible squirrel nest sighting. Lush vegetation obscures the road, but not the sound of traffic. A baby cries. Paw prints — canine, not squirrel. Tree branches jump in the distance — a squirrel? No. Exhaust from a museum vent. A jackhammer pounds in the distance. No squirrels — What has man done? NOTE: It was very loud and packed with humans and dogs in this area. A wedding party stopped for about five minutes and were really loud. It was really distracting. Walking when the sun started \\nto come through the trees, so\\nI looked to my right to see \\ntwo big grassy hills, and \\nthe sun shining rays through\\nthem, highlighting the leaves\\n+ pollen falling through the\\nair, as if it was raining\\nin slow motion.

You are a guest, sit! The path leading from Hunters\\' Gate (@ 81st) seems little used, and despite being near transverse and Central Park West, is a tranquil area with good benches and convenient rock outcroppings. Man was filming a woman with her dog (looks like a service dog). Looks like dog was performing trained good behavior, such as iContact and going in circles around woman.\\n\\nAnother man told me I was “going the wrong way“ to leave the park. When I told him I wasn’t leaving, he asked where I was going. I didn’t know how to respond. Lots of birds — robins and blue jays near garage. Squirrels #3 and #4 hid until I walked away and came back to play. Squirrels #5 and #6 could care less I was there. Closed lawn — hopped fence. Central Park Conservancy crew/volunteers cleaning brush here.\\n\\nOverheard two women who were lost trying to find their meeting point say: “We should’ve just picked a good, obvious place like King Jagiello.” *sunglasses emoji*\\n\\nPassed a Sighter couple in the field: “My husband\\'s tracking one … Ralph! Ralph! Over here.“ (Turns out Ralphs undergraduate degree is in wildlife biology.) Ducks and geese on Turtle Pond, turtle on rock getting sun. Both squirrels left area and went north while foraging.\\n\\nSquirrels #3 and #4 were together at first. Both near the base of a tree. Squirrel #4 went up the tree for a few minutes, then came down rejoin Squirrel #3.\\n\\nAll four squirrels were in fenced area so no humans or dogs; only one dog off leash after 9 a.m. Apparently, squirrels aren’t exactly theater nuts. \\n\\n(Most of this hectare was not accessible to the public and/or squirrels, but I saw tons of birds.)\\n\\nP.S. I 100% felt like a character in a minute, even while sitting alone at the Romeo and Juliet statute looking for squirrels (in vain!). :) Sad man playing \\n\\nDog in one squirrel area \\n\\nCat on a leash Zoo squirrel activity (high winds), but more birds than I’ve seen in any one area. Perhaps because of wind, they all congregate in a slightly sheltered area. Mainly robins, on the ground, on low branches, all over. Nary a squirrel to be found. Very few squirrels since noise. The squirrel that’s very nice was Squirrel #2. He was curious. A lot of kids playing around. - Cellist playing in the Greywacke Arch-way. I hate to say it, but they leave a lot to be desired.\\n\\n- Squirrel #3 had an enormous \"flight distance.\" I was 25 meters from it, and it scurried up an oak. kids playing ball -- screaming \\nwondering among the trees \\nlots of people on sidewalk All squirrels in this hectare were nice and polite. I had a staring contest with squirrel no. 3 and I won. Squirrels are known art lovers so I expected to find several mulling about the Met. I was not disappointed. \\n\\nA French family approached me, wanting to know what I was doing. They immediately wanted to assist, and were critical to spotting Squirrel No. 3. #NAME? Tourists looking for the Museum of Natural History, oh no!\\n\\nA nice woman offered the services of her pooch to help find the squirrels. I politely declined. One squirrel (#1) was burying acorns and after using its hands to bury it, kept using its body to jump down / compact the soil further. Didn’t move on until it was satisfied. Also looked both ways before crossing the sidewalk. A good squirrel. Some women are setting up the fanciest picnic I’ve ever seen — pillows to sit on, glass bowls w/ candy & food, a cake stand, a whole table. 70’s style victorian dress. Looks like fun. Birds here are super fat. - Guy on a bench jamming on his electric guitar so I\\'ll be grooving to that this whole hectare.\\n\\n- I love how the little cheep cheep birdie feet sound on the crunchy leaves when they hop along the brush.\\n\\n- Thank you, Squirrel Census! I\\'m sitting on a roc No squirrels to be seen. The road nearby was quite busy, loud. - Really varied seeing squirrels on the ground vs. in trees\\n- Fair amount of dogs off leash in the open green spaces\\n- A toddler was intently watching a busker play music.\\n- A dog was nomming on a stick twice his size and it was glorious. \\n- Walking back Helicopter / car horns / sirens / buses\\nVery close to 79th St. Transverse. \\nPeople exercising.\\nDog baring — thought it was a squirrel.\\n\\nSaw just two squirrels that both appeared small and young — they were eating, running, indifferent to me, though aware of my presence and went elsewhere when I approached a bit. 2 helicopters 1 loud airplane passed overhead sirens X2 acorns — many *zero squirrels sighted* I waited until 9am so that dogs would be back “on leash” — though some were still off leash for a few more minutes. For most of the observation period the area was bustling with humans walking (with and w/out dogs), jogging, biking, and rollerblading — before work or on the way to work. Several park vehicles were out (landscapers). I first walked the perimeter, then walked around inside. I heard what I thought was a squirrel in a tree and walked toward it, but it was a bird. —> As I was making notes (9:36 am +/-) sitting just outside my designated area/hectare, 1 single juvenile squirrel — gray with cinnamon highlights came toward me (I was sitting on a bench by Delacorte theater) A family of 6 people speaking French came up and were very fascinated with the squirrel and tried to give her/him an acorn… but s/he already had one…then took off behind me. First three squirrels seen were so busy eating and chasing. 7 young men played football under large oak and weeping ____, having fun & voices their frustrations through groans. \\n\\nI encountered one squirrel from afar and later came upon another one (or was it the same one) close by -- maybe 20 ft away -- eating an acorn. It was calm. When it finished eating, it looked at me for 30 sec, then came down the tree and continued on its way. A baby cuddled next to a golden retriever. Babbling like crazy (the baby). Seemed like the baby was saying, \"Get me a dog, Mom and Dad.\" Lucy (Huang, freelance reporter) discussed the squirrels with me for the radio while we walked. Same story early shift near walkway -- Doggos! Doggos amongst the trees where I see big [unknown word: \"drays\" ??]\\n\\n- And nothing on the G. Lawn :( \\n\\n- Interaction from well to do pretty person w/ fancy doggo -- \"You Doing Squirrels?\"\\nMe - \"yeah :)\"\\nHer - \"Ha. Ha. I knew it!\" - End Scene - \\n- Found nice fallen drey [what is this?] - (Pic) Found an abandoned tennis ball close to the Met. There\\'s a sad doggo out there somewhere. This seems a popular path for dog owners to travel. A human was talking to his dog and said, \"You\\'re looking for squirrels, aren\\'t ya?\" I wanted to enlist the dog since I didn\\'t see any squirrels. Maybe next time. Squirrel seen at 4:42 PM just behind Field #1. He’d stop a moment, do a tail twitch, then continue. Did this two times, then fled when he or she saw me.\\n\\nAcorns are bouncing all around me. I see a very large squirrel nest high in an oak tree.\\n\\nSquirrel seen at 4:54 PM. Tail twitching, he scaled a four-foot wire fence.\\n\\nHeard kukking, couldn’t see squirrel. Lady with her dog asked, \"Are you censusing?\" - dead bird by MET :(\\n- many sirens driving by main road (2 ambulances. 1 firetruck.)\\ngrey squirrel by Alexander Hamilton Squirrel #1 was on a tree watching a nearby couple pass. I started to take a photo and the squirrel looked at me as soon as the shutter clicked. We both kind of stared at each other for a few seconds and I started to take more photos, he kept cocking his head until eventually making his way down the tree and slowly coming towards me. I kneeled down + we  stared at each other again until a dog ran over and scared it off. It ran back up the tree Lots of birds (especially robins, red breasts) \\nlots of oak trees and acorns \\nno squirrels Very quiet. Didn\\'t see any other animals or humans! Nice little lawn between Cleopatra\\'s Obelisk and the Sculpture Cafe — lots of birds. Some woodsy parts with a bit of goldenrod, a few big trees, and an HVAC vent/staircase.\\nOne oak tree with leaves starting to turn. They said there wouldn’t be squirrels here. They were wrong. Area felt damp and cool — secluded. Quiet. Because the area was lined with a museum wall along with a wall of trees and vegetation, the squirrels seemed to be protected from humans and dogs. I asked the Met grounds guy if he ever saw a squirrel on the side of the Met. He thought for five seconds and said, “Raccoons, rats, pigeons — but no, never saw one squirrel!“ \\n\\nAggressive pigeons and loud fountains. (Koch Brothers near.) There were no squirrels in this hectare, just people sitting in the sun waiting for the Met to open. - Man and woman look as if to be meditating at the top of Summit Rock. - Squirrel number 2 jumped while being vertical, climbing up a tree, to another tree. Not from branch to branch, from trunk of tree, to another trunk of the tree. It was incredible, be Both squirrels were on the rock ledge overlooking Central Park West Rd.\\n\\nThere were a lot of birds — sparrows, pigeons, Cardinals due to birdseed scattered on the ground. Lots of thick ground cover in this area; tons of birds (robins?).\\n\\nWhile looking, I got hit on the head with an acorn but still only saw one squirrel in the whole hectare! Our second hectare seemed to have few squirrels -- until we ventured off the road into the woods. I don\\'t know why it surprised me -- it was quiet and seemed empty -- and then they slowly emerged. They seemed less territorial and chased each other less. It was a peaceful walk and we noticed more than we usually fo, which was lovely, making us want to take more walks. Squirrels here have it in for the birds, mostly a bevy of robins in the berry trees and on the ground.\\n\\nHot spot for serious birdwatchers. They\\'re all wearing green and have telescopic lenses.\\n\\nKid is trying to teach his mom how to throw a ball properly. 9:25: tree shredder started. 9:30: Not so calm for now. Rumbling into distance now. Camouflaged photographer with two birders. Now a whole flock of birders. ! Summit Rock is where my friend has her yearly birthday picnic (14+ years now). I\\'ve watched squirrels build drays and pointed them out to kids in attendance. \"Weird squirrel guy\" = me.\\n\\n- Caught great high-rise drama between two guys trying to cross a gap. :) Sighting a few hawks flying nearby assigned hectare. Once at the assigned hectare, I spotted several squirrels. All of them were running and ran towards me. One guy was interested at what I did & asked a lot of questions. I saw a dog chased one squirrel up to a tree and a couple who gave squirrels some nuts. Lots of runners and small birds\\n\\nMany small trees with berries\\n\\nFew runners on bridle path. Our first hectare was quiet and breezy, with birds everywhere. After our first two sightings, some acorns fell down and as we looked up we saw one so high up – we would have entirely missed it peacefully eating while crumbs fell from 30 feet up. Then our eyes adjusted, and they were everywhere. They seemed to chase each other territorially — but not much verbal communication. They were eating more than I thought. I thought he would be foraging and collecting more. We learned a lot. I met a couple coming to feed peanuts to the squirrels. They come every day. They have been observing a pregnant squirrel for a month + feeding her \"extra\" peanuts. They could ID her because it \"looked like she was wearing brown gloves\" (she has brown front paws). The juvenile squirrels do not know that this couple brings food. The couple said that the young squirrels \"learn\" to eat peanuts. Very busy dog run area. Lots of matching midsized poodle dogs. Hounds and sheepdogs. Rather rambunctious goings-on. Squirrels are missing. Waiting it out, most likely. The Great Lawn was closed, but the one squirrel I saw was munching away right by the baseball diamond.\\n\\nOn the path, which was lined with benches, an old lady was sitting next to her dog, both on a park bench. \\n\\n[Illustration of dog] Caption: \"If only I could get on to that lawn.\" Nest in tree, large. Great Lawn closed! Walked on outskirts. Zero squirrels! I was disappointed that this hectare didn\\'t have any squirrels. The walking path on the east side of the Great Lawn was very busy and a lot of dogs were off leash. We saw two squirrels – both under nut-producing trees in the Great Lawn. Dogs would come to the fence surrounding the Lawn to watch them forage. They were far enough away to be unbothered by the voyeuristic dogs!\\n\\nThe Race for the Cure March was also going on on 5th Avenue and producing a lot of ambient background noise/chanting. Probably too far away to spook the squirrels, though. I know they\\'re not conducive to squirrel sighting, but I love how many dogs are off leash, walking around like they\\'re the best party host, greeting everyone like the stars that they are.\\n\\n8:59 a.m.: I was chosen by one to give it a pet!\\n\\nWhat looks like a Breast Cancer Awareness March is coming through — lots of chanting and cheering! (The cheers I heard were actual cheerleaders.)\\n\\nSquirrels #2 and #3 were near a nest! (Wasn\\'t sure which made the kuks so marked both.) General area has quite a few people (not packed), but it’s quiet with mostly ambient sound. Lots of people lounging on the blankets.\\n\\nOne section of grass around 40 sparrows foraging together, almost like grass. A lot of Rob also spotted. Lots of intermittent helicopter noise. \\n\\nTwo walking paths divide the hectare, and most squirrels were foraging in the strip of land between them. #1 - half-tailed Man playing with his dog. Family picnic. - Hawk was being mobbed by black birds.\\n\\n- Squirrel #1 stayed very still on the tree branch.\\n\\n- Squirrel #2 running on ground then ran up a tree where it met Squirrel #3.\\n\\n- Squirrel #3 ran around in trees. Currently blocked off for construction, no access. Breast Cancer walk coming by. Lots of cheering! Under construction: The north side of the Met is walled off due to park enhancement project. Barely any squirrels at all. Not busy. Limited ground near streets. Seemingly little to no wild foliage. Very busy. Not surprised by lack of squirrels. Surprisingly little litter. There were no squirrels in this location. Hot dog vendors were setting up for the day, however no one is buying hot dogs at 9:30 a.m.\\n\\nAn employee is driving around in a vehicle vacuuming up leaves — very noisy. 2&3 - playing, chasing, not biting, jumping on back, stopped on small tree & groomed themselves, one appeared to mount the other. #7 stayed in top of tree - jumped from one tree to another. Had an acorn in mouth. Lots of small children (playground). Dog walker. Unbelievable, no squirrels! Lots of trees. Nest (maybe a raccoon nest). There is a nest on one tree where 2 spotted 3 juvenile squirrels running & chasing each other. One started to make sound “Auaas” while stomping on the branch of the tree. A couple passed by and tried to play with one of the squirrels. On the other side, I spotted one dead pigeon. Squirrel #3, maybe #6 from Hectare 21-A. Did not find squirrels in busy areas. Turns out squirrels eat mushrooms! And they are picky about which ones to eat. Squirrel #5 ate a mushroom -- but only the biggest one out of about 6 on the field. \\n\\nThis area had lots of squirrel activity & ppl doing all kinds of things -- strolling, exercising, walking dogs. Many people commuting to work but is quiet and away from traffic. Lots of trees and other types of birds. No squirrel attacks here, but one was lively, scaling a fence then running through foot traffic to a tree nearby. 9:28 a.m. — The empty softball fields look like a pristine battlefield — red flags abound and blow in the wind. Do the squirrels see them as signs of peace or war? \\n\\n9:30 a.m. — A fence surrounds much of the area — no dogs allowed. \\n\\n9:31 a.m. — This mighty oak must hold squirrels — but alas ...\\n\\n9:33 a.m. — Trees with red berries. \\n\\n9:37 a.m. — Squirrel-HO! One-two-three squirrels! Two chase each other up a tree, the other ignores and forages. In an area at pines — on the edge of hectare — out of the softball fields. \\n\\n9:42 a.m. — Acorns litter the visitor\\'s bench. \\n\\n9:45 a.m. — A group of youths appear in matching jumpsuits to do jumping jacks.\\n\\nAddendum — 9:49 a.m. — A squirrel, but well out of my hectare. You win this time. The great lawn is closed.. No movement/2 squirrels. No dogs – very few birds.\\n\\nOne sighting just on boundary of squirrel in tree. Second sighting just behind home plate of squirrel eating. Lawn is closed, so walking around it.\\n\\nPeople walking by with balloons for a party, including and Avengers balloon and a Peppa Pig balloon\\n\\nGray squirrels outside boundary (one north, three south, least southern squirrels not labeled on map)\\n\\nLots of nuts. squirrel #4 seems to enjoy classical music. I saw many squirrels here because of lots of trees and grass. There was a group of elementary school kids playing kickball. This hectare also seems to be a popular off-leash area for small dogs. I found a dead squirrel in a fenced-in area. Squirrel 2 attempted to scale the green construction wall before returning to the black fence. Squirrels 3-7 are definitely fans of trees —> are all hiding in the holes of trees, came out all at once, then they chased each other down the tree before returning to the inside of the tree - all facing away from the runners. * Squirrel #4 had a huge piece of bread and seemed very protective of it. \\n*Hectare was really busy. Lots of people on bikes, ringing their bells, and kids running and screaming around. Only saw sSquirrels #7 and #8 after a dog barked. They ran from brush up two different trees, and flagged tails. The squirrels were very curious about us paying attention to them, and Squirrel #1 and #2 walked toward us, probably to beg for food, seeing as they were young. An abandoned toy truck, Iron Man ball - sparkly headband \\nat the playground - and one kid playing alone on a cold morning ! * Wedding party at Marymount \\n* Ancient playground was very busy.\\n* Nests noted in oak trees in park and in tree line next to Met.\\n* Only squirrels noted were on the Osborn Gates (ferrous sciurus) Saw teenagers doing sick wheelies on bikes on my way to the quadrant. This is a busy, built out area with a lot of concrete (playground, sidewalks, street, museum). A lot of people, a few dogs on walks, some sparrows, some migrating birds way up in the sky, but not a lot of animals otherwise. Some fallen french fries outside of the Met were surprisingly unmolested. No squirrels :(\\n\\nDid not check inside museum. \\n\\nMetal squirrels on Osborn Gate (and other metal animals). Lots of gingko trees near the street. 4 Hawks flying high overhead. Saw 1 dandelion. Lots of dogs & walkers. 1 low flying hawk. Near (adjacent to) 2 playgrounds. Oak trees did not have many acorns on ground. It was quiet at the beginning but towards the end, I spotted three squirrels spreading in one area. I noticed no sighting where the area is near Central Park West. ROBINS HAVING BATH\\nBLUE JAYS \\nWOOD PECKER \\nONE SQUIRREL TILTED HEAD STRANGELY \\nWHILE CHEWING It was a chilly, wet morning, the kind that makes humans and squirrels alike want to stay in bed. Saw around six humans stroll through my space, nearly all with dogs. The playground was locked closed and empty. But just south, beyond th-- Squirrel #2 up and down tree with leaves.\\nSquirrel #1 continued to eat and hide nuts. Saw a good example of tail flags (it would seem I look like a predator). Also watched a squirrel tear a mushroom to pieces -- as it ate, it cocked its head back and to the side. Squirrel #1 took off into Hectare D.\\n\\nSquirrel #5 on swings. The groundskeepers call squirrel #2 Anthony. They like him. Named after coworker. I couldn’t see a single squirrel! They were very ornery though. Lots of kuks and quaas when I started walking the hectare. For a while I was the only person in the area, and for the half hour I observed there was minimal dog activity. Quiet and busy areas.\\nBusy areas — kids playing/few squirrels.\\nAdults playing ball.\\nSquirrels mostly in bushy, non-busy areas.\\nContent, foraging — healthy-looking squirrels. #NAME? Red flags on field observed from path, sign says: “Great Lawn: closed for the season to rest“\\n\\nHearing kuks, I think, no sightings. \\nFour squirrel nest sightings. \\nNice passing sighters “in the field” * Dog intently watching squirrel #1 \\n* Area very calm \\n* Squirrel #2 very acrobatic \\n* Lots of nerf bullets Most of this area was taken by humans playing various games. Lots of rats by the bridge and Reservoir — SAD.\\n\\nTwo squirrels in 21-G.\\n\\nA very exciting flag football game of kiddos was going on, as well. Potentially scared squirrel friends away, though. Somehow no squirrels! \\nSeems like they should be here. But--\\n\\n- The wind kicked up\\n- Caravan of police cares w/ flashing lights drove by \\n- Caravan of screaming school kids also went by Area is loud and busy due to proximity to pedestrian paths near Met and traffic. Lot of pedestrians below bridge #24. Quite a few children yelling. Lots of flowering shrubs — parts of the area smell strongly like melon/honeydew. Two rats spotted near trashcans at South Gatehouse. Area is generally VERY noisy with lots of joggers and families skirting Reservoir. Not much grass — mostly sidewalks and dirt. Not many squirrels. #s 2 and 3 were in brambly area with ground covering and small, low trees. There was a fancy poodle with bows galore. (x 2)\\n\\nTwo Central Park Conservancy workers were cleaning up trash.\\n\\nNo squirrels here :( too bad. * lots of birds, wide variety\\n* birds were eating bread loaves A lot of ground cover in this hectare — particularly myrtle plus evergreens. Tall trees but no sightings. Big pieces of bread and some sparrows. Squirrels #1 and #2 were chasing each other up a tree. Squirrels #2 and #3 chasing each other up and down tree. \\n\\nLovely brand-new renovated paths and lawns. A young woman had her rotund white chihuahua (illegally) off leash in the area between the playground and the Transverse. \"Slow down!\" she kept crying at it. \"Slow down!\" Despite the fact that he never seemed to progress above a waddle. Maybe she was on the phone. A lot of people walking and biking along the paths here.\\n\\nA ballerina (in her tutu and ballet shoes and all) was being photographed doing ballet poses by Bridge #27.\\n\\nSquirrels seen in wooded areas that are mostly fenced off, near the paths. Dense shrubs plus ground cover Very loud! The road was busy and the walkway by the lake full of runners.\\n\\nStill, just when I gave up hope, a rogue squirrel spotted me on his way up a tree. We stared at one another for a few moments and then moved on, though not in my heart. This hectare is mostly a police precinct, high fences, and a busy street. If I was a squirrel, I wouldn’t live here either. The only squirrel I saw was eating trash by a picnic table. I was mainly in the parking area and I observed a few nests yet no movement or signals of squirrels near them. I’m walking more toward the police station to see what I find. Once again I believe the weather conditions are affecting the sighting. [lots of notes surrounding the map]\\n\\nQuadrant has varied territory: reservoir + path, \"wooded\" area + bridle path, transverse, precinct + park area behind it. I expected the squirrels to be in the wooded area (there were a few squirrel-like nests there), but  all the squirrels I saw were just southeast of the precinct. 3 of 4 were foraging there, in a more grassy, park-like area w/ trees but little undergrowth. People were a) walking b) jogging c) dog walking. It was busiest near the reservoir and got quieter as I went south \\n\\nSaw off leash dog chase squirrel outside of quadrant while walking away Since a police station, highway, and reservoir were part of this hectare, I didn’t see a lot of squirrels. It’s a popular area for running. There were no squirrels here! Bummer. Some people looking out at the water. Generally a peaceful place. Some people picking up litter here. One or two nuts. Not much activity due to the presence of water. I feel like I failed. My father grew up in a poor Kentucky valley and used to hunt flying squirrels so his mom could make squirrel stew. He just died in April. I think he\\'d be amused that I was out searching for squirrels and not finding any!\\n\\nThis area has a lot of foot traffic but also a lot of noise from the cars on the 85th St. crosstown. The gusty wind is really blowing the trees, so not sure if that’s why they aren’t up there. A tiny sliver of lawn that squirrels use for short-term foraging before dogs scare them into the bushes. No noticeable tree activity. Aww, the runners from the race are singing the \"I Love You\" song from Barney! \\n\\nTwo dogs came running up to me with a tennis ball.\\n\\nThere are nuts in the area from an oak (?) tree. No squirrels in the water, much to everyone\\'s surprise.\\n\\nA small yellow and gray bird landed on the ground right next to me feet. It did not seem concerned that we were towering over it and less than a foot away. lots of people walking and juggling \\n\\nI had been walking along the path looking up into the trees, not seeing much. \\nsuddenly, a flash of movement! \\na squirrel ran across a high branch and seamlessly jumped across to a branch of a neighboring tree. maybe it was late to the monthly council meeting. Many joggers in this area. A few nuts scattered around but a noticeably lacking amount of squirrels. I looked up, and the squirrel was frozen on the side of the tree – tail towards the sky, head towards the ground! It kind of gave me a lot of wary side-eye before it turned to climb the tree. We were approached by a young guy walking his dog. He asked what we were doing and when we told him we were sighting squirrels, he said there\\'s a particular squirrel in this hectare who always \"teases\" his dog! The dog was off his leashed and caused the few squirrels we saw to rush up a nearby tree. Spoke to a woman who said she has observed fewer squirrels since the park was renovated. There is a puddle in the area--\\nHeard the hawk\\'s noise.\\npeople are jogging and running all the time. #NAME? The fences were very hard to negotiate. Lots of humans, dogs, noise, runners, bikers, kids, helicopter buzzing, ball playing. But no squirrels. Construction vehicles parked on Bridle Path.\\n\\nEven more busy than 29-B. \\n\\nOnly two pieces of litter! Obviously dropped by accident. A small flock of birds exploded around me on the path, their wings snapping like fingers at a poetry performance.\\n\\nNo squirrels. Lots of runners , no squirrels.\\n\\nLots of teenagers taking photos and teenagers running. There is a maintenance crew. They are tied to the fence, leaning out over the Reservoir with weed whackers, clearing the bank. This forces the runners to detour. Many acorns along path – evidence of squirrels not seen.\\n\\nExtremely heavy foot traffic. Overheard: spirited debate over energy gel between runners, someone is not excited to attend a wedding ...\\n\\nMild comedy: flickering look on runners faces as they approached and passed by, as I am friendly enough looking woman wielding a pencil and clipboard. I can see the wheel spinning – “oh no, not a petition/fundraiser/any and all things that someone with the clipboard might be hawking on the Reservoir trail.“ The typical city demeanor (neutral to all things) taken to the next level. Ha ha. 23 mallard ducks\\n1 weird dog (plus weird owners)\\n1 lost shoe (size 4 toddler)\\n\\n3 police cars\\n3 ambulances\\n1 fire truck\\n(with sirens on)\\n\\n• squirrel\\n* red cardinal\\nX squirrel nest Large tourist group We saw a runner, no squirrel encounters. Lots of people and couples! There was a bridge nearby but no people around the bridge. There were a lot of birds in the lawn. We had trouble sighting more than 1 squirrel in this hectare, but maybe that\\'s because in t he  middle of the hectare was a big tree. And about 40-50 feet in the air, what do you know but we spotted a raccoon sleeping on a branch!!! Lots of joggers, dogs, and birds. There is a Breast Cancer Walk and runners both in my area. Dogs drinking from a puddle in th green path. Hunting dogs running wild with no leashes. Lots of nut-providing trees but no squirrels. Thank goodness I saw a squirrel at the very end. Pretty high dog activity even after off-leash hours ended. Lots of runners. A lot of runners and birds. One man looking at vegetation and birds, I think.\\n\\nThe two squirrels were foraging and climbing. They didn’t seem bothered by me and my talking to them. They looked up at me and gave me some lovely little eye contact. [marked on map: \"woman saw 2 on path earlier\" and \"loud truck\"]\\n\\n3 squirrels were interacting together on a tree chasing 1 for a nut & seemed 2 know each other. 2 males, 1 female, bonded \\napproached me and were very curious \\nall the squirrels I saw had nuts or were chasing for nuts, all squirrels looked healthy / were at the bottom of or in tall trees \\npeople knew what i was doing Nest building — at least 30 feet up a tree. Cancer walk in pink, supporters cheering with hope, where are the squirrels?\\n\\n#1 rolled in a patch of loose dirt, they found #2 and they chased a lot [or \\'about\\' .. hard to tell]\\n\\nentrance to secret lair [marked on map] We started our squirrel counting in great anticipation — we headed towards location 26A off 90th, and there we saw six squirrels. They were very much the same. Most of them were kind to us and acted like they like humans. When we headed towards 90th St., we found a baby squirrel injured with what looked like broken back legs. We brought him back to Gothic base, Bridge #28. Safari Park was closed and fenced off due to construction. But I got in! :-)\\n\\nManaged to scale fence and found two hiding in a very safe area! \\n\\nIt was very apropos that this last hectare was abutting my very first hectare. I felt I’d come full circle (sappy chords).\\n\\nOMG! My favorite spot under a tree looking up. Nothing. But I saw a white burst of color, I followed it south and it had a squirrel oddly patronizing me at the end :-) Observed just one little dude in this area — tons of foot traffic, dogs, a group of very young kids, walking two by two, in formal blue uniforms. A good spot for Central Park Bingo. Khakis/ties/Bluetooth guys, tourists wielding selfie sticks precariously close to the Reservoir, someone running full sprint while Facetiming, and I mean, really a tremendous variety of dogs. Our Squirrel #1 appeared to notice a small greyhound nearby. But dog paid squirrel no mind at all — a very chill city dog, indeed. Extremely busy area. A lot of runners and dogs. No squirrels seen. We saw a squirrel! He/she ran down the tree, over the lawn, up a fence, and over the fence to another tree. Also, a dog jumped a fence. He was a big, white dog. There was a man on the phone whose eyeglasses matched his sweatshirt. Nest here inside of hectare. Squirrels #1 and #2 in two different nests, neighbors. Heard squirrel babies.\\n\\nLots of people out running. Very leafy traffic area: walkers, runners, bikes, tourists, etc.\\n\\nOne squirrel (#3) jumped down from 15 feet straight to the ground to pounce on a nut (?) — most aggressive foraging move I have see so far. \\n\\nSquirrel #3 also repeatedly returned to same tree branch to eat after foraging, sat in crook of branch and trunk. All of Safari Playground is under construction. Squirrels #1 and #2 were playing together. I believe the weather conditions are affecting me on spotting some squirrels. Also Safari Playground is under construction, therefore I wasn’t able to get to the center of my hectare. I tried as much as I could to look inside the construction, but I didn’t see any squirrels. I found Squirrel #1 by the sidewalk. I saw other squirrel nest but no more squirrels. A passerby stopped me to pitch a \"Squirrels of Central Park\" children\\'s story. Does the Census have an in-house publishing unit? There are no squirrels in this small triangle of rock next to the reservoir. \\n\\nWe were excited to see a turtle swimming by, it claimed no squirrels frequent this shore. Lots of walkers, runners, people taking pictures. Very busy area. Tons of foot traffic and dogs off leash (but, many truly adorable dogs sighted). Squirrels tend to use the trees as highways. Lots of fresh horse manure. \\n\\nSquirrels eating Beech nuts. #NAME? Like the crying child in the pink polkadot bike helmet, the squirrels have no interest in going to the playground. (The child eventually gave in.) For the squirrels, things were much more interesting around the trees — but close enough to the street that they had the chance to rummage through food litter.\\n\\n* An old couple nearby adorably argued. \"Yes, you wrote me a poem.\" (He didn\\'t believe her.) There was an area with trees and brush that had litter but it’s where I saw the one squirrel. This hectare was very, very busy. I was surprised to not find any squirrels, but this year amount of people and dogs in this part of the park must be keeping them either away from here, or hiding. Squirrel nest in big birch near north boundary, no squirrel seen.\\n\\nRobins all over a berry-producing tree near West Drive.\\n\\nTree buffer between Bridle and West Drive only active squirrel. Two squirrels — one high up in tree, one running up tree.\\n\\nLots of nannies and kids.\\n\\nSchool class doing relay races — too loud and raucous for squirrels to want to come here. #NAME? This was bonkers. Squirrels chasing squirrels! Related looking squirrels! I bet it was a squirrel soap opera. A note that there were hardly any dogs, which was v. unusual - Squirrel #1 was very skittish -- nervously foraging as I approached, until an inquisitive dog hopped up to the fence and scared it up a tree. \\n- Surprisingly few squirrels, but quite a few chipmunks, and ground-foraging birds. Runners on the cinder sound like squirrels kukking. Just a little bit. Just enough to notice. Those runners need to pick their feet up.\\n\\nA lot of birds. Lots of trees with berries. A birch tree, too.\\n\\nI was starting to think we had zero squirrels. Fellow counter Caterina was counting the hectare next to me. I said, \"I haven\\'t seen any.\" She pointed and said, \"There is one right behind you!\" Sure enough! I said, \"You saved me.\" The squirrel ran into the trees and bushes. Woman walking along reservoir asked if I was counting squirrels 1. Dog ran for squirrel 3\\n2. Squirrel 6 was eating a mushroom Most of this hectare is water, so I spent 20 minutes and feel quite confident I have seen all the squirrels.\\n\\nI was asked whether I know anything about trees, since I was looking up at them. Unfortunately, I don’t. Tons of joggers this morning, so only squirrels I\\'ve observed have been in this wooded corner of the hectare. Two pairs of squirrels chasing each other up and down two large 30 foot trees here.\\n\\nSquirrels #3 and #4 spotted again near the end of my time foraging at the top of their tree. Lots of human activity on the different footpaths.\\n\\nFrench tourists successfully cycling with no hands. Biggest dog-walking crew I\\'ve seen (14) and all the little ones are wearing raincoats! \\n\\nOne of the benches is dedicated to Bain Antell, \"City Woman, Jersey Girl.\" A good amount of noise - traffic \\n+ horns, dogs scrabbling, kids screaming \\nin the park Kids playing hide and seek outside the playground. \\n\\nThis path is not right. It is a \"volunteer\" path that peters out into the field. Kids showed up right as I sallied and they started practicing soccer. Lots of birds foraging. Several oak trees. Squirrel #1 began tail twitching on the side of a tree after fleeing from me. It had an acorn in its mouth. Dogs playing fetch around the area.\\n\\nSquirrels found outside of hectare, but close by. Squirrels #1-3 were seen on neighboring oak trees. Squirrel #1 was just making its way down a tree while squirrels #2 and #3 were chasing one another up a tree and making short \"kuk\" noises to one another.\\n\\nCrossing the bike path, saw two 20-something guys maintain a wheelie position for 25 meters. The bike thoroughfare is pretty much a constant stream of bicyclists, joggers, gold carts.\\n\\nAt the very end of the count in this hectare, I spotted a pair of falcons swirling around one another mid-air, seemingly in a mating dance and squealing/chirping. Squirrels #1-3 were seen on neighboring oak trees. Squirrel #1 was just making its way down a tree while squirrels #2 and #3 were chasing one another up a tree and making short kuk noises to one another.\\n\\nCrossing the bike path — saw two 20-something guys maintain a \"wheelie\" position for 25 meters.

Two people were feeding Squirrels #8 and #9 on the grass. Very busy — tons of kids, runners, bikers, dogs. \\n\\nThis area comprises three very busy walkways, including the road. Zillions of people out. I think this area serves as an unofficial dog park. There were lots of off-leash dogs and, perhaps because of that, less squirrel activity. Birthday party occurring.\\nVery busy area. No squirrels. A dog chased the black #2 squirrel into the hectare. Black squirrel seen in next quadrant (29-D).\\n\\nI love my button.\\n\\nMy feet got wet. :( 1. I had someone ask me what I was doing. He was in the middle of a phone call and still asked me and told the person on the other end that I was counting squirrels. He seemed really interested and asked if I had seen the black squirrels. Well I Finally saw a [\"my\" crossed out and replaced with \"a\"] Black Squirrel \\non my Second Day. \\nTalked to a Very opinionated Lady \\nwith a type of Hunting Dog who \\nTold me a story about 3 Baby squirrels \\nwere thrown off a tree by a male \\nsquirrel. \\nThen I heard Nut Hatchers. \\nThen I think I heard Squirrel Squacks. \\nAlmost I Got run over by a Bicyclist \\non a path. Grey one chasing black one all over the place — black one seems “bold” — gray one having none of it! Doing the tree trunk “garland” twirl — chasing — One has the sense they do this regularly — This lawn area is a great spot — Lot of shrub cover — trees + rocks — squirrel playground, for sure. There is a large 30th birthday picnic by the big rock formation in the southwest section of the hectare. They have several toddlers in tow that are running around and squealing.\\n\\nOn the northern end, all the tennis courts are in use and you just hear the sounds of balls bouncing off rackets.\\n\\nBy this time of the afternoon, and with the sun, the light is reflecting off the water in the reservoir and making it hard to see up in trees. Lots of grumpy children As this hectare was majority water, I was able to closely observe the landed area. Alas, department workers started dragging hoses in and out of the gate house, and runners kept stomping through. Department workers started making repairs inside the gate house with loud equipment at the end, so none spotted. 11 seagulls\\n103 runners\\n67 dogs\\n17 wannbe runners\\n0 squirrels\\n0 amphibian squirrels (by accident, by design)\\nsquirrel nest Squirrels separated from paths by geography and foliage. Despite quietude, strangely few squirrels and those seen were pretty shy. I have forgotten how to dress for 50° weather. The leaves are changing. The off-leash dog had some really impressive leaps over fencing – she was slaloming over them back-and-forth! Saw some partly eaten fruit. No swimming squirrels. The narrow path by the Reservoir is like playing Frogger with all the runners. Where do squirrels go when it\\'s cold and rainy? Very busy area with runners and dogs. There was some landscape work going on — two men were digging a hole. Lots of runners around the area. Kids running around. Choppers making really loud noises. AS seen also while counting squirrels. \\nStarlings ~ 15\\nRobins (flock) ~ 30 \\nBlue Jay (calling)\\nGrackle, catbird, sparrows (sp?)\\n2 Squirrel nests in 30-B\\nSquirrel #3 in tree w/ lots of robins Picnic. Three people throwing a football. Kids and dogs climbing a rock. Found possibly injured baby bird. There is a man with an easel painting the rocks in the lower left of the hectare.\\n\\nAnother squirrel appeared on the border of 30-A/B about five minutes after I finished my count and then started chasing a third squirrel around a tree trunk. My two hectares were right next to each other, so I was really surprised how many more squirrels were observed here. Despite the business in proximity to the street, there are so many clusters of squirrel life. I tried to look in the trees but they went so high I lost sight. There’s a creepy bush where I heard rustling, and I peeked in but didn’t see the source. Was as likely a raccoon or rat as a squirrel. Thought someone was saying, \"Squirrel,\" but it was a tennis score: \"Four all.\"\\n\\nSquirrels don\\'t enjoy tennis. There’s a lot of off-leash large dogs. This may be discouraging for squirrels in this area. MANY DOGS OFF LEASH \\nFRIENDLY LADIES (3) WALKING DOGS -- CAN\\'T BELIEVE I\\'M COUNTING SQUIRRELS! Squirrels, it seems, do not care for tennis\\n\\nEven among the nutty & fruity trees outside the courts, I saw no squirrel activity. I thought perhaps they, like the human spectators, sat still in the trees watching the matches play out, but even at 5 o\\'clock alarm, when games ended & began , I saw nothing. \\n\\nI did see two adult cinnamon/gray squirrels eating in the grass in 31-D as I made my way around I’ve seen two prescription bottles but no squirrels yet. :(\\n\\nI’m excited when I hear a rustle in the trees/grass but disappointed when all I see are sparrows.\\n\\nSo many sparrows. Can this be the Sparrow Census instead? A man attempted to enlist his beagle alongside me in the search but the beagle quickly lost interest. Squirrels 2 + 3 were playing with each other, climbing up + down the trees. Note: It looks like they are trying to get rid of this car. There is a fence around it.\\n\\nIt is after 9 a.m. but there are still dogs off leash.\\n\\nThe sun is burning through the clouds. Nice morning.\\n\\nToday is the last day of the count! Zero scores. It’s just too busy for runners and dogs. Too many openings and humans to be very good squirrel habitat, along with the lack of nut-bearing trees. Dead rat.\\nIt\\'s really breezy.\\n0 (zero) Relatively quiet. People lounging, not loud. It\\'s very windy here.\\nZero. Combo of rains\\nSmall tract size\\nNo observation.\\n\\nDid spot a well-placed\\nbirds\\' nest. 0 squirrel.\\n\\nTiny area (but with one tree that had good squirrel potential) Saw two young children fall down on purpose to get their parents\\' attention and then the parents spent 10 minutes making a big deal out of it. We saw a tree with almost all red leaves. Playground closed.\\nSurrounded by gate.\\nNo squirrels.\\n\\nTook about 10 minutes to get out\\nof park to count section \\non 5th Ave. — none. Busy location.\\nBus was pulled over on W. 96th with ambulance. Kind of hate creeping around the playground with my camera out :(\\n\\nWouldn’t expect too many on the “playground island“ – very heavy traffic surrounds\\n\\nThough the one I spotted was next to the playground. There were so many birds in this hectare! I saw a bunch of different types, especially one with a red breast (not a robin though) (unless American robins are different from European ones). Big/huge nest high up in tree. Maybe 25 to 30 feet above ground. \\n\\nThey were climbing above the nest and seemed to be playing.\\n\\nReally, really loud by playground. Lots of games going on. MANY DOGS \\nTENNIS I saw a one-year-old\\'s birthday party in the park. The baby was completely naked and the parents were taking many photos. They kept saying, \"Hey, Bobo.\" Group of three teens smoking on the side of the large rock.\\n\\nThere was a dude sitting in the thick underbrush of trees. I saw movement and thought it was a squirrel, but I then made eye contact with a human — NOT a squirrel. It was very strange. * Car accident on transverse with police sirens, so may have scared squirrels from path\\n\\nAlso, a homeless man sitting against fence making noises!\\n\\n* Around 10 dogs off leash around center of hectare. * Car accident on transverse with police sirens, so may have scared squirrels from path\\n\\nAlso, a homeless man sitting against fence making noises!\\n\\n* Around 10 dogs off leash around center of hectare. For all the woodland charms of this area, there were far fewer squirrels than expected. Abundant acres went ignored. It was surrounded by the 97th St. Transverse and tennis courts/worker using hedge trimmer, which probably didn’t help. Sole squirrel was spotted with acorn in mouth, so timid that when s/he spotted me s/he froze, tried to back away, and nearly lost grip of the tree because s/he was trying to climb down while watching me. Lots of runners & dog walkers \\nHear wind blowing through the tree as the sun peeks out of the sky. There are tennis players. Bike riders. Red Breast Robins hopping around. There is a water fountain where runners stop to drink water. That is something I have not seen in a very long time (a working-park water fountain) Hear ambulance in the background. Leaves are starting to change color. So many doggos!\\n\\nI walk through this section about four times a week a little later in the day and see many! This is the first \"cold\" morning. I think they are sleeping in. They are usually in open areas but at this time many dogwalkers. Argh! So many dogs!\\n\\nOne of my trips through this section this summer, I found a dead squiz at the base of a tree. Two others were standing \"over\" him for a while — I buried him (X on map). There were many nests in the trees, but few appeared. They appeared in bunches. There were none, and then, suddenly, they came down from their trees. Loud sounds from adjacent tennis courts\\n\\nlots of birds calling\\n\\nbig group of dogs here\\n\\nlots of birds in bushes\\n\\nno squirrels out in open\\nmaybe because many dogs around and off leash even after 9 a.m. Dogs on leashes, mainly. \\nLoud bluejays.

Lot of people strolling through the park walking their dogs or conversing\\nHot Dog vendor near by. Lots of off-leash dogs Squirrel spotted after two dogs alerted me to its presence on a tree. \\n\\nSquirrel froze to avoid further attention. It’s after 9 a.m., but there are several dogs off each. I am also off leash, so I imagine we are just about equal in that regard.\\n\\nI am standing next to lamp Post 9618. Once upon a time that meant something. “Hello police! I am next to 9618! Save me!”\\n\\n“On the way!“ – The police\\n\\nThere are pros out there that know where 9618 is. They know where every lamppost is. \\n\\n“Hey Sarah. 9618 has a burnt ball.“ \\n\\n“On it,“ Is what Sarah would say. Thanks, Sarah!\\n\\n<--- This fence does not jive with reality and needs to be reviewed. Dirt path is fenced off now.\\n\\nReally busy – many people getting off work? Also a dog run nearby; noisy on the transverse side.\\n\\nSquirrels #3 and #4 were tag teaming in a tree — three up top, four lower to ground. Not one! Found zero squirrels. Got lost in North Meadow. \\n\\nNext to construction zone, playground closed. Lots of scaffolding/fencing around — in addition to the different path heights, this zone is pretty tricky to find. 1 - Extremely scampery. \\n      name: yohan\\n2 - No tail! Seems sad! \\n      name: shlomo\\n3 - name: hazel \\n4/5 - These squirrels are friends. \\n      names: Rosencrantz and Louis Chasing birds and chattering - Was stopped by 2 men from  China asking for directions to Strawberry Fields\\n\\n- About 3 different dog walkers let their pets charge @ squirrels\\n\\n- Noticed a squirrel pulling new leaves into a tree hole while a couple biking on the west drive rested again Saw a chipmunk in\\nthe brush alongside\\nthe transverse highway Area had great mix of tall trees — lots of drays in beginnings of construction. But I did not actively see squirrels bringing nesting material today. All were concentrated on food, I guess. It’s a busy morning. Dogs run around off leash. Their people run or walk nearby. Traffic flows consistently along the Transverse. Park crews run lawnmowers and weed whackers. A man sets up a wooden easel and starts to paint. Beagle baying, baying, baying. Person walking the beagle was wearing a scarf over her face and the leash was attached to her fanny pack.\\n\\nTwo women rehearsing a play.\\n\\nClouds moving fast across the sky. Breast Cancer Walk with lots of people. Woman yelling, \"Charlie!\" trying to find her white Lab. \\n\\nSquirrels #2 and #3 together.\\n\\nMany squirrels in a bushy tree area here.\\n\\nWoman holding dachshund up to the water fountain to drink. :) Man massaging his Lab with a roller massage tool on the dog\\'s belly. :) Another man with another dog taking a photo of that from far away. Now they are talking to each other. #6 was very curious when we approached. He ate a peanut and a mushroom. Lots of tail twitching. \\n\\nWhenever we approached the squirrels, they would circle around us as opposed to approach us head on. I saw nine squirrels on the ground near the tennis wall. They all looked small and young. They all searched or ate chestnut on the ground among birds. The smallest one did not scared at all. It stood on hind legs and watched me. #NAME? Heard bluejays squawking \\nPeople keep talking to me \\nNuts dropping -- are the squirrels telling \\nme something? (Get lost!)\\nSquirrel in tree after nuts. \\nBig old leaf nest in tree -- no activity. \\nFound a ball! Saw lichens \\n#3 was really tugging at something buried --\\nWasn\\'t able to unearth it. \\n#3 Eating then washing tail!\\nMushrooms!\\nSaw a young black squirrel! \\n\"Are you counting squirrels?\" One woman asked excitedly. \\nMet a \"Brit\" walking his dog. #1 spotted on plane then climbed tree w/ white food in mouth -- did not want to be my friend :) :( \\nLarge mushrooms in area -- may have been what was in squirrel\\'s mouth\\n#2 dug small hole + patted in down w/ a couple of leaves -- Then went back up the tree from where s/he came \\n\\nMet woman walking dog (Golden) wanted to know what I was doing -- she complained about the Central Park Conservatory -- that no one does anything but drive around in their  carts. Ah. NYC -- a city of complainers. \\nShe was my good luck charm as I saw (w/ her help) squirrels #4-7! --> #14 -- I heard a THUD! Squirrel fell from huge tree 50 feet up. Seemed unfazed. -- scurried up tree after 30 seconds -- Back on the horse! :) Squirrels #1 and #2 initially observed separately foraging — climbing, running. A bit later, seen chasing one another across expanse of grass above transverse.\\n\\nSquirrels #3 and #4 foraging, separate. Lots of squirrels running back and forth, possibly just to confuse me. Lots of dogs off leashes.\\n\\nVery pretty guy (squirrel). Saw him yesterday.\\n\\nBeautiful oak (?) Numbers #1 and #2 gathered near the base of tree — foraging and digging, jumping from spot to spot. Squirrel #3 initially up tree, then joined #1 and #2. Approximately 6 to 8 small birds also foraging in same ground area.\\n\\nSquirrels #1 and #3 chased one another around tree base, up-and-down trunk, and on ground.\\n\\nSquirrels #1, #2, and #3 eating, standing on hind legs. These squirrels observed me walking nearby and proved indifferent when I moved closer. I’ve never seen a squirrel resting, taking it easy. They are all action, all the time. Not that it’s always work they are doing. They play a lot, run back and forth just for the glee of it. Most of the time, life is about food: finding it, hiding it, eating it.\\n\\nLots of small birds — brown. Small birds, robins. Big trees. The bushes by the wall \\nof the transverse are \\nfull of tiny birds. \\nThe foliage shakes\\nwith their movement \\nand their chatter\\nand chirp fills the air. Squirrel #1 burying/digging nuts under a beech tree.\\nSquirrel #2 ran up oak tree with acorn, gave me a tail twitch. A little girl lost her frisbee over a fence and tried to find a gap for 15 minutes before her father lifted her up and plopped her down on the other side. Lawnmower speeding along in East Meadow. Lots of dog walkers with on and off leash dogs along east west pedestrian path. Busy with people — quiet with squirrels.\\n\\nThis section has a good amount of unreachable (by me) space, due to the transverse. Surprised I didn’t see more squirrel activity in the big elms in the area. After 10 minutes without a single sighting, I heard a rustle above me and felt something fall on my head – a branch, maybe? Thanks a lot Squirrel #1. :( \\n\\nSquirrel #3 ran away from me but then came back (within a respectful distance) and stared at me while eating acorns. Seemed very pleased with himself or herself. Pretty quiet, squirrel-wise! I circled back and a dog was at the base of one of the trees where I saw squirrels a few minutes prior. Dogs off leash: just one.\\nSmall number of people out, some walking dogs.\\n\\nSquirrels #2 and #3 were climbing together.\\n\\nEast Meadow fenced off, but still had clear view of grass and saw no squirrels on it.\\n\\nSquirrels #5 and #6 were climbing and foraging together. Very quiet area devoid of people. Saw only one person walk by on path - she stopped to ask what I was looking at because I had binoculars up. Movement I saw ended up being a bird in the grass. Palm warbler I think - I blame the shrubs for providing cover because how could i mistake a tiny bird for a squirrel Tree trunk w/ human-like face\\nWoman foraging Ginkgo nuts \\nFree roaming dogs gone at 9 am\\nChipmunk Fair number dogs out — seven that were off leash. People passed through the area every few minutes; overall conditions were pretty calm*. Quite a few birds in the trees, flying from tree to tree, and on the ground as well. (Majority of birds were sparrows and robis.)\\n\\n*As far as humans are concerned. Heard but not seen: kuking (?) from tree \\nmore mushrooms! \\n\"Are you a Parks person?\" someone asked. \\n\"No, I\\'m counting squirrels.\"\\n(to gales of laughter)\\n\\nSomeone pointed out a knothole in a tree where he said \"squirrels used to live before raccoons kicked \\'em out.\" 3 little dogs off leash created a little havoc at first. Once that died down a bunch of squirrels approached me (almost right up to me) they were foraging next to ball fields (& lots of people runners / bikers & dogs) & ignored all the activity. They\\'re so cute up close! <3 So many squirrels! \\nIn a small area \\nsurrounded by foot paths \\n& a loud playing field \\nOne fat one hung upside down on the bottom of a tree for 20 mins Most of this hectare is an athletic field -- several teams were practicing Ultimate Frisbee. I didn\\'t venture too far into the field because I was afraid of getting hit in the face by a frisbee! \\n\\nSquirrels #2 + #3 were the most blasé squirrels ever. They just briefly looked up as I approached + then promptly forgot I was there. If this was the toddler soccer player census, I would’ve been in the perfect spot.\\n\\nJust kidding – found a little crew of squirrels away from the tiny soccer players. Really cute goal celebration (and some not-so-cute soccer parents).\\n\\nNo squirrel friends on the area of the field of this hectare, but I spotted a few on the field and 34-C. Squirrels #1 and #2 high-speed chase between beneath branches of two trees and the ground — small adults (?) similar color and markings. Oberved five nests distributed across five trees in close proximity. Other noise: weed whacker alond edge of path, close to trees. Squirrels continued to run between branches above. The garden was very busy this afternoon. I saw three wedding parties taking pictures, clues for a birthday party scavenger hunt, and the New York Historical Costumers\\' Society out for a stroll in gorgeous Victorian dress! A man spins a whirring contraption like a top controlled by a string with two wooden rods on the end, with the man uses to manipulate the top in yo-yo like tricks. It’s noisy and mesmerizing. It’s black squirrel country over here. I feel like I may have found a family. Squirrels 6+9 could be the same. 6 ran into a tree hold & was very vocal. 9 looked like it could be a mother who was nursing. This hectare runs through a playing-field area. There were three to four games taking place. At one end, there were piles of acorns on the ground but no squirrels. \\n\\n* Found one at the last second! Squirrels in this area seemed more skittish. Group of five teens throwing and catching baseballs (right side of path).\\n\\nThere are so many squirrels here. They all hung out along the fence, running back and forth. I couldn’t keep track.\\n\\nI saw a woodpecker for the first time.\\n\\nMet these two guys looking for mushrooms. I got so excited to see them all come out of the tree at once. Squirrels #5, #7 through #11 were in the same area of three trees, and I loved watching them all interact. Quite a lot of this hectare was also red flagged fields. Treeless & flat.  But in the smallest cluster of trees were such bird & squirrel diversity! Eventually 6 chased 5 around until 5 fled & 6 got bored. Not many squirrels, but two bluejays landed near me — and one was carrying a peanut in its beak! Father and daughter playing softball \\nShe\\'s pretty good! \\n\\nSquirrel #2 was very engaging. \\nHe climbed up onto a tree and came about [unknown word] to me (maybe 2 feet away) and he [unknown word] upside down on the tree and sort of lunged at me with his torso (not aggressive) (more playful) very cute! 9:10 a.m.: Yipping dogs! A dog walker\\'s dogs are barking so loudly at a single owner\\'s only dog. Went on for five minutes.\\n\\n9:22 a.m.: Saw the cutest family of squirrels hiding in a tree! They would peek out, run around the hole in the tree, and then go back inside. Just witnessed (and video’d) Mama & child squirrel play-wrestling…pretty adorable… school kids —> More ovals. Still no squirrels. \\n\\nJust outside my hectare, a red-tail hawk pass @ a sq. which ran up a pine and began calling / moaning softly. Hawk flew off. sq. ran from hiding spot to perch on branch and continued calling Squirrel #9 looked suspiciously at me while using its hind legs to pat the ground protectively! A squirrel tucked its tail over its shoulder. I didn\\'t know they could do that. I found a Samsung cell in the grass! Going to try charging it and returning to rightful owner. playground closed (under construction) \\nchildren playing in surrounding area \\nkids chasing squirrels (1) + (2) leisurely chase btw trees and ground -- against backdrop of playground noise emanating from playground nearby. \\n(3) foraging along open ground until v. large dog bounded up (unleashed) the owner sat down on a nearby rock and began clipping coupons from a grocery store circular. The dog did not give chase once squirrel ran to a nearby tree. Guy running barefoot with duct tape around his feet.\\n\\nPlayground closed for repair, lots of birds in the playground.\\n\\n(Tiny) goldfinch in a branch. Not very many squirrels in this area. (But lots of stares from people wondering why I was walking around with a clipboard!) \\n\\nAlso spotted a man with a sign that said \"Global Warming Is No Hoax!\" Lots of people (some with dogs)\\ncrying children \\nbaseball game One of the squirrels was jumping around, + looked almost as if it was chasing the sparrows for fun Several dogs off leash on path. Squirrel #2 was in tree 30 feet from nest. Lots of nests in trees near #2 spot. Around six. Squirrel #1 on ground within fenced in area (baseball field). This hectare is almost entirely open field. Frisbees and footballs were being thrown, soccer balls were being kicked. A pick-up game of soccer soon materialized, and shirts came off, which was fun in almost all instances. But there was tree in the NW corner of the hectare and other large trees near it. That\\'s where all three squirrels were found. I can\\'t say they were indifferent. They went about their business, but they seemed very aware of me. They didn\\'t run unless I approached them. First time seeing black squirrels. There are people playing soccer on the field. I find the squirrel sitting on a tree above me. It looks calm watching people. After a while, I find it’s dressing itself on the tree. I lost sight when it climbed up the tree. Mostly large open area; not many squirrel sightings. This hectare was mostly an empty field between baseball fields, with just a small patch of trees at the top. There were a lot of cute dogs around. Many dogs.\\nTree trimmers, loud!\\nNo squirrels :( I am always struck by a great beauty and variety of trees here. I am glad to see younger trees planted among the grand old ones. Although there were no squirrels active in this hectare, there were many in adjacent hectares.\\n\\nIn the field, there was a group of 10 young men with padded replicas of swords, clubs, and arrows playing a combat game. Over the distant sound of kids playing soccer, they yelled, \"Good arrows!\" and \"Regroup!\" A one legged man on a hand powered tricycle wheels by slowly enough to see me spying on a squirrel. There are many communities using the land here, the squirrel among them. \\n\\nA group of tough white boys bicycled by me, dropped their bikes on the ground, and sat on a rock listening to Eminem. A Central American family picnicked on a rock with large coolers of fragrant food. Their children were in superhero costumes. Kids playing! Climbing trees.\\n\\nRobins, woodpeckers\\n\\nDogs, some still off leash\\n\\nDog had Squirrel #1 treed. Screaming kids in playground — private school, red sweaters. \\n\\nPretty pines.\\n\\nTai chi woman — rap music, HS students in big class.\\n\\nDog walker w/10 dogs.\\n\\nMight need to be recounted. - a bird\\n\\n* There is a squirrel nest in the tree. \\n\\n- It looks like Squirrel #3 runs across from the playground back to its nest on the big tree. The resident squirrel feeder arrived + threw an unidentified substance (?) at squirrels #2 + #3. \\n\\nSquirrel #3 made a little sneeze (like an exhale, but with a puff). \\n\\nWoman ran past with her dog + yelled, \"Are you counting squirrels? Awesome!!!\"\\n\\nI had the best conversation w/ a mom + her son about the project. Son: \"Why are you counting squirrels?\" Mom: \"Why NOT?\" Kids listening to music / smoking pot \\nman at pool doing Tai-Chi\\nTwo rats \\n\\nSuch a nice day lots & lots of\\npeople & dogs in the park Overall, conditions are similar here to Hectare 33-A. People came through area every few minutes (about half with dogs). Fewer birds, though, than in 33-A (except for ducks on pond). When my alarm went off, Squirrel #8 got intrigued and came down from his tree to investigate. It was interesting to see the squirrels hiding out so close to the road. Two different dogs chased squirrels. and one dog was not allowed to chase squirrels (he and owner just waited several yards away) One squirrel was fed by a nice grandpa and chased by the grandson Another quiet hectare - squirrel wise. \\nOn any other time walking through the park I feel I see them everywhere, but now that I am looking for them I only come up with a small handful. \\n\\nI wonder if they prefer a later shift-like most NYers. A dog chased #1 up an oak, and it kicked, quaad, and tail signaled (flags and twitches) within 2 minutes it was back on the ground, but it would stop + flag or twitches its tail every few seconds. The others and it all ran to trees when some leashed dogs came near. Lots of off-leash dogs, including one very disobedient, very happy \"Vinny,\" who very much wanted to go for a swim. These squirrels are destroying this tree! \\nI forgot to name these squirrels. What a great time to be in the park! Migrating birds are everywhere. It’s hard not to get distracted by them.\\n\\nI heard Squirrel #1 in a cluster of trees, as a mob of blue jays was gathering. Perhaps they were preparing to chase away an animal. Mama Squirrel!\\n\\nWalk-a-thon passing through. Lots of pink! High school soccer game goingf on next door.\\n\\nKids game, too. \"That\\'s your team. They\\'re wearing your jersey.\" — father to son\\n\\nHawk just let out awesome screech.\\n\\nGoal! Cheer goes up in soccer game. \"Woohoo!\"\\n\\nLots and lots of joggers. The majority of the area, the baseball fields, was red flagged, but since it was empty and flat it made for better viewing. Squirrel #1 was spotted by a tourist mom of a family who shouted, “Ben, chase the squirrel!“ The son dutifully ran after the squirrel, who hightailed it. The son quickly lost interest but the squirrel hit behind a well-placed short offshoot of a tree. S/he kept peeping out till s/he felt safe, at which point s/he started nibbling on acorns. We had a moment. (#1) Black beauty running from dogs on leashes\\n\\nQuintet of teenage boys hanging out on rock just behind field #9, listening to mediocre-at-best rap music. Squirrel #2 was climbing with a twig in his mouth. It was obvious he was up to something important. The trees here weren\\'t very numerous or condensed. That oval was completely unexpected. \\n\\nFew to no most trees, basswood, maple, pine, cherry \\n\\nMaybe squirrels aren\\'t here b/c they\\'re freaked out by unexpected ovals Some joggers and walkers on East Drive, but the rest of this hectare had very few people.\\n\\nHeard quass from high in the tree here, but didn’t spot squirrel. I spotted a handful of teenagers hanging out on a rock, smoking weed. Four boys, laughing and enjoying themselves. 10 a.m.: Rain stopped! \\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of small fruit trees (cherry-like, small red clusters) and lower/shorter trees for ground cover. \\n\\nSurprising how few people there are, but there\\'s not as many squirrels. Must be the noise from cars along the road. Football game being played nearby didn\\'t bother Squirrel #1 :)\\n\\nSquirrels #5 through #8 in the enclosed field.\\n\\n- Drone was awesome!!! An African-American gentleman wearing a jacket with a huge \"Red Sox\" on the back walked a black dog. At a corner of a hill, a woman took pictures using a tripod, but disturbed by an intruder (me), she left. A serious birdwatcher? Had a staring contest w/ squirrel #1. \\n\\nA man asked me, \"Do you know why there are so many black squirrels?\" I shrugged. \\n\\nSquirrels #2 + #3 chased each other! \\n\\n#2 eventually approached me on its hind legs + puffed out his/her chest. Very difficult terrain!!? Group of three squirrels foraging and eating and occasionally chasing each other around.\\n\\nWhen I walked by them, they seemed more alert, but generally did not run away. In fact, one squirrel with chase another one, which had to get closer to me to get away from the squirrel. This happened twice. Squirrel #2 kept chasing a chipmunk away. Three French and Two German tourists zeroed in on this. At one point while digging, squirrel #2 came across something that made him jump up and run a few feet away. Somebody enjoyed some marijuana. Far more chipmunks than squirrels visible. Very dense woodlands with dense undergrowth probably hid more. A fair number of people, but they were quiet and stayed on the paths. Chipmunk\\nFrisbee players\\nPeople taking photo squirrel eating seeds\\nRobin taking a bath in the stream\\nFishing in pool Squirrel trying its hardest to pull the acorns off the tip of the branch without falling was a comical sight. Makes you wander what is so good about that acorn that makes it better than all the easier grabs around it. The little guy came running over when I made clicking sounds. It came over about 3 ft away & got on its hind legs & put his paws together & looked like it was moving its paws like it was begging. \\n\\n[also noted on front page: Dog chasing two squirrels up tree] Fred\\'s Team (charity) had an event set up for runners with dogs. Very quiet. I think a man with a dog thought I might give him a ticket or something because he moved to a more secluded spot to play fetch with his dog off leash after 9am. A juvenile hopped over to me, stood up on its back legs and cocked its head as if to say “?” I got a quick picture of it before it decided I was a SERIOUS THREAT and bolted. Possible nest! I came across a photographer seemingly taking photos of birds.\\n\\nSaw orange butterflies flying around the North Meadow Butterfly Garden.\\n\\nNo squirrel sightings near a group of teenagers playing soccer. Squirrel 2 was found because of how loud it was eating. No squirrels.\\nAlmost attacked by dog! :( (1) small hawk attempted to grab squirrel from ground near base of tree\\n-Remained on ground making kuks & quaas for 30 seconds --> ran up tree -- stopped on branch for several minutes - unmoving \\n\\n(2) foraging between trees in fenced in area Squirrel #1 foraged and found an acorn, went up oak tree. Because this area is hilly with relatively expensive views of the hectare, this is an accurate tally even though I officially observe only one furry friend. Observed 1-2 squirrel nests in trees at 102nd and btwn 102-103. Large number feeding just inside the park, including many juveniles (incl. several very small ones). It\\'s a quieter spot w/ few dogs, maybe a blue jay nest, so lots of activity. \\n\\nI walked past one family and I swear as I went by, the father muttered to the mother \"squirrel census.\"\\n\\nOne squirrel was munching on an entire sandwich. Not clear whether it was found or stolen. It was super quiet, and then around 9:10, I heard all of these kuk-kuk-kuk sounds from the trees. Squirrel #4 was eating, and as I approached she left her food and started climbing. She seemed scared. Tons of little brown birds around. Squirrels #1 and #3 started chasing each other and playing. They climbed two trees together super fast and also made lots of kuks and quaas. uneventful; had a group of picnic-ers. \\n\\nvery quiet. \\n\\na couple dogs on walks. Discarded red pair of shorts When I approached, Squirrel #1 ran up the fence, then ran up a tree. I sat down on a lovely boulder, and Squirrel #1 came back down, then vanished into the underbrush. One lone squirrel with his back towards the humans munches without a fear or a care. (1) foraging \\n(2) foraging + ran from me + climbed tree and waited, watching, did not retreat further than 10-15 feet. \\nObserved against back drop of dozens of screaming (like, really screeching) children running around nearby field. \\n\\nHuman encounter: cutting through opening in trees. run across a guy, mid-20\\'s, alone w/ bicycle, asked what I\\'m doing, I explain, he gets real quiet. Then says, \"That just bugged me out, like, in a good way\" - I wish him a good day, walk on, then I hear him calling me back --> \\nI walk back and he shows me the edge of a pipe and says, \"I\\'m not smoking weed or I would have offered you some -- I just didn\\'t want you to think I didn\\'t want to kick it with you.\" I reassure him that it\\'s all good, no offense taken, we fist bump. I walk back toward the pool. MAJOR squirrel party over here! It was such a sight. \\n\\nSquirrel #12 was sadly being chased by a dog named \"Ziggy\"\\n\\nAlso accidentally walked in on a private/very hip garden party -- is that allowed in CP?\\n\\nWas such a lovely + lively squirrel sighting spot! Man yells at dog, dog barks at man, squirrel quaas at both.\\n\\nLots of dogs and people loose!\\n\\nSquirrels heard: many.\\nSquirrels seen: few. Lots of squirrels were foraging in the heavily wooded area with the birds. The pedestrian trail has steps and the \"flat\" path. The map does not reflect that. \\n\\nChipmunk! Two! A fair number of people on and around Great Hill. One group was having a picnic. A few kids on bikes. A few dogs. Squirrels #1 through #4 observed all at one time. While following the squirrel, a small warble flew up to me and began scolding me. It flew from perch to perch around me, scolding me the whole while. The squirrel slipped off during the diversion.\\n\\nSquirrels #2, #3, and #4 chased each other; #2 especially kept the others from getting too close. Two cute tiny chipmunks played around. \\nThere was a humming bird like Tiny bird Squirrels #2 and #3 were both foraging in the same tree, hence the double-X. Squirrel #4 was intently chasing a chipmunk, often in circles, until a group of teenagers wandered into the woods and scared off much of the wildlife. Also, a young Russian couple walked through to pose for photos on the rock feature. I didn\\'t see a lot of communication -- or perhaps I\\'m not great at identifying it. The chipmunks and birds are vocal, but the squirrels calmly go about their business. \\n\\nAs I write these notes, I look up from my clipboard to see a squirrel looking me in the eye. He steps forward, puts a front paw to his chest, \"Who, me?\"\\n\\nYes. You. Lots of joggers, bikers, cars, and construction in this area. Only squirrel spotted was in a wooded area. 2 - buried nuts in branch and debris pile at dumping ground \\n\\nsaw bird kill butterfly \\n\\nwait, squirrel might have [unknown words]\\n\\ntar pits We saw some urban foragers. Sassafras tree\\nDead apple tree\\nBreast Cancer March along\\nperimeter — no squirrel There was a wedding party in the gardens taking pictures! Squirrel #1 ran across the path with an acorn in its mouth. It seemed to notice me, but did not react except to move more slowly. Then a man came up behind me talking loudly into his phone. #1 dropped its acorn and ran into the bushes. I stayed 5 minutes, but it didn\\'t come back. \\n#2 ran into a tree when chased by a dog, and there were at least 4 others. I suspect #2 is the one that ran from the tree up the rock first (see vid), called the second one down from the tree #6 #NAME? Most squirrels spotted seem to be searching for food or eating near trees. Spotted several feeding outside this zone on the walk to it. There were lots of couples out on dates, a formal wedding party doing a photo shoot, and a model and photographer also taking photos. This last pair was using some flowers as props, and as they finish they handed her flowers to a young girl who was with her parents. Her smile was beautiful. It was great to see such a random act of kindness. Squirrels #3 and #4 might be the same as #1 and #2. Two human children in the Children’s Glade. \\n\\nNot much squirrel action near the road. \\n\\nFound a cool rock ledge overlooking the avenue. Gorgeous area of woods, tons of trees. Way too close to a big dog party and a lot of street noise. It’s so noisy! A cement mixer and moving truck are mixed in with the traffic. Lawn mowing is in the next quadrant, along with a group of screaming kids on the lawn. At the end, a group of chatty school kids walked by. The squirrels went about their business, chasing each other and foraging. One squirrel approached me, as if to ask whether I had food to satisfy on this windy, cool day. There was a ton of activity on the Great Hill. \\nFrom 9:05 to 9:25, about 12-20 people and their dogs were gathered + playing off leash. At 9:30, a classroom of 45 kids came to the hill + ran around + screamed + played + chased birds. I can hear a lot of [unidentifiable word...\\'talks\\' maybe] in the trees. I\\'m not seeing a lot of them; however, I did see one in the tree. \\nAlso lawn mowing was happening\\nEarly on, two ladies walked up to me and asked me if I was counting squirrels. Kids in woods acting like \"Lord of the Flies with their sticks, hitting things, shouting. \\n\\nCross-country team on Great Hill track. There was a lot more squirrel activity here - away from the crowd of children (that is now 100+ screaming kids). When approaching certain areas, I could hear quaas, from the trees (even though I couldn’t see those squirrels. But I’d hear quaas from the trees when I was approaching or I saw people with dogs approaching. There were many birds as well. (sorry, hands were cold) * Man feeding almonds to #9 --> he got uncomfortable when I asked why he\\'s feeding almonds and not acorns (we were right by an acorn tree) and left\\n* So many chipmunks near the meadow! \\n\\n* Transcendental yoga on top of Great Hill Not a lot of squirrels, but there were a ton of cute dogs playing together — probably around 30. Squirrels came out right after my sampling time ended. Out-squirreled again! Lots of runners and cyclists on West Drive. Very few dogs. So many chipmunks. As much as I enjoyed the commuter squirrel duty, being immersed in the middle of the park allowed for a much more “lively” squirrel count. Here I witnessed squirrel after squirrel or just doing squirrel things and it was enlightning, to say the least! What I found most intriguing with this hectare was the ability for the squirrels to peacefully feed, forage, chase, and run with the tight paths and the streams running in and out. The dogs were fewer, as were the people. The comic relief came when the leaf blower got turned on and the two I was observing scattered. quiet woods. skittish squirrels\\npaper bag in tree Garbage truck drives away.\\n\\nGolf cart.\\n\\nWater main trucks.\\n\\nThis rock is more like a long hill of bedrock with some grass and trees. Squirrel #8 stayed around for 10 minutes. She was foraging most of the time. It’s hard to climb with a clipboard. I looped around to the A.H. Green Bench to get my bearings, hiking and climbing east. I topped a ridge and proceeded down to what looked like a deer trail. There I encountered my first squirrel and a gaggle of school girls who ran screeching when they heard me approaching.

It took me about 20 minutes to start seeing squirrels. So I started asking people if they\\'d seen any squirrels and nobody had. Just as I was about to give up, two squirrels started running around on the lawn. As I started to head back, I found one eating and one diving into the bushes. Four squirrels in about four minutes. But that\\'s all. A child is celebrating his 4th birthday. His friends and family are currently in the middle of an egg race??? Music nearby with tambourines, chanting, just outside southern edge of hectare.\\n\\nLots of activity in field areas — circle of chanting people with tambourines nearby, soccer game, picnicking families, and screaming children. There were none at first in the open areas, but then the children ran into the wooded area shrieking, and flushed several squirrels out.\\n\\nIn the wooded areas, there were tons of chipmunks and very loud blue jays. I saw a squirrel en route to location [marked] 1 on West Drive. I told him “Happy Squirrel Appreciation Week!” While walking here, a runnerman asked & yelled, \"Hey! What are you guys taking notes of?\" After telling him we were conducting a squirrel census of the Central Park, he said, \"Cooooooool maaaaan.\"\\n\\nSquirrel #1 was \"passing through\"\\n\\nSaw a hawk! two kids\\' parties were going on during \\nthis sighting session.

A beleaguered parks employee was seen [unknown word] out new graven on a running path - disrupted [unknown word] by a tour group, then by runners, then by a parks dept vehicle, etc. etc. A Sisyphean task. \\n\\nLots of geese dunking their heads under water in the Meer, but no squirrels. :0 We saw a Sweet 15 party.\\n\\nWe enjoy ourself this time around. We felt safe and plenty of pretty pictures. Guy blasting music w/ a speaker \\n2 squirrels running together \\nFood cart\\nLots of dogs Even though I only saw 4 squirrels (as close into the park and far from the street) I enjoyed scouting for \"commuter squirrels\" attempting to transcend societal spaces delegated to them. Unfortunately I was unable to witness the dreary early morning commute, but I was able to catch a glimpse of a baby up in a tree! Quiet, mostly litter-free area. We saw more chipmunks and squirrels. One large hawk! Squirrel #5 was very bold! Squirrel-on-squirrel fighting between 1&2, and then 3&4. LOTS OF CHIPMUNKS \\nSO MUCH TRASH\\nWIDE VARIETY OF BEERS I forgot a note from Oct. 19, 2018 / 23-H / PM\\n--> The one squirrel observed was missing most of its tail. It only had a 2-inch stub, still as fluffy as usual. \\n\\nFor today, one path in 40-D seems to be where all the squirrels hang out. They were all quite skittish, very quick to climb up or run away when they notice a person nearby I saw a chipmunk, does that count?\\n\\nSquirrel #4 was being stalled by a HUGE Red-Tailed Hawk, and a few other small bird cronies. Squirrel #2 climbed tree and went into knot and climbed down. Then crossed the drive, barely missing the bikers and off into the woods. Squirrel #3 eating nut sitting in tree – dinner! Woman cleaning off things she foraged in the Meer. \\n\\nVery loud barking bulldogs with sticks in their mouths probably keeping squirrels away.\\n\\nMany tiny sparrows fluttering around up on the rocks overlooking the Meer. It was very peaceful here, a very quiet corner of the park. There were many bushes and areas of tall grass that were just teeming with little birds of many varieties. Spoke to a dog owner about letting the dog chase the squirrels.\\n\\nThis time around we enjoy ourselves. We felt safe. Difficult spotting.\\nThey were up in the trees. \"Have a good day, Boo Boo.\" \"You too, Baby.\"\\n\\nIn low shrubbery. So quiet! Family fishing, older man playing harmonica on bench next to the Meer. Large oak in bottom left of quadrant, but no nests or activity. Lots of birds chirping and eating berries.\\n\\nWoodpecker! Wild raspberries.\\n\\nLots of activity on walk through North Woods to Meer. Squirrels #1 and #2 chill foraging activity Saw a chipmunk and a big group of big group of birdwatcher. Apparently, it is bird heaven, not much for squirrels. * Sighted a hawk heading toward the North Woods \\n\\n- Spoke with a man sitting in a wheel chair in the sun on Fifth who asked what I was looking for. \"Birds?\" \"No: squirrel count\" \"Why\" \"It\\'s information--like how many people live in NYC\" \"Oh yes!\" Then he told me of raccoons living in a tree off Fifth just inside the Park + of a \"giant\" raccoon who forages in garbage pails on 107th each night, whom he sees from his apartment. Dozens of children in playground \\ngeese heard: saw 3 geese \\nvery loud.\\nlots of hawks in sky. \\ngirl feeding pigeons. \\n\\n(1) eating berries in a tree\\nguy playing drum w/ dancer. I was so excited to see a black squirrel, and followed him jumping from tree to tree. Suddenly he turned around and stared at me, as if asking, \"Why are you following me?\" Under the 110th Street Bridge, a man and his trainer listen to smooth jazz while he lifts weights. His grunting could be scaring the squirrels. \\n\\nDo squirrels like the rain? \\n     Birds don\\'t seem to mind it.\\n     Neither do chipmunks.\\n\\nOf course, I saw five adult squirrels on my way to 40-D. 41-B is a quiet, forested area. There was few passerby — one guy maybe was doing drugs, and a few hikers. One couple were walking her dog. There were a few chipmunks on the ground. Generally, very isolated. I saw a black squirrel run up a tree in a gray squirrel chased it, up 25 to 30 feet. Very large chipmunk population, it turns out! There were no observable squirrels by the kid\\'s playground. Noise and lawnmowers may account for this, but more likely the absence of oaks, almonds, and sizable trees. In the off trail area, squirrels were plentiful – and not altogether friendly. There are several people sitting on the rock where the block house was. It was a cool area of the park I\\'ve never been in before and I want to come back and explore.\\n\\nEmerging onto West Drive, everyone biking was starting to struggle on the hill. One little boy, maybe seven years old, was whispering, \"Push it, push it,\" with every pedal, motivating himself to make it up the hill.\\n\\nI saw a lot more chipmunks than squirrels here. Lots of construction noise. One squirrel followed me around for a bit (Squirrel # 2). Sirens and ambulances passed several times. Guy talking to himself, taking a leak. A squirrel had something in his mouth, maybe an acorn, and started digging a spot in the ground, buried it, and covered it back up with dirt. Rock climber \\n\\nsirens\\n\\nHauled butt up tree after scoring his nut while other squirrel stood upright and watched, perhaps w/ acorns. \\n\\nArgument over dogs: \"It\\'s your responsibility, not ours!\" When I saw the first squirrel, I said, \"Oh my god!\" It was so still. Cyclists, runners on road\\n\\nPretty calm inside forest area\\n\\nSquirrel were very indifferent. A few nut-producing trees, but no signs of squirrels. (Or nests.) One just beyond my hectare! \\n\\nA man paced back and forth singing to himself.\\n\\nMallards nested (?) on the island. Weeping willow.\\n\\nGuys fishing — father/son (teen). Start laughing at something very hard, buckled over. \"Sorry, we\\'re not crazy.\" — teen\\n\\nMan screaming, ranting. No squirrels. :(\\n\\nThis area was mostly water and big rocks. I did see a lot of sweet little birds, a dad teaching his daughter to fish, and a precious couple taking engagement photos! Two bulldogs trundled up to a small gaggle \\nA goose hissed. A different goose honked. \\nthey stood their ground. the bulldogs retreated. \\nAlas, there were no squirrels in sight. Geese and ducks sleeping under a tree next to the nature center. Lots of dog walkers, cheers and laughter from the playground, chirping birds, and some early crickets. Trees near terrace full of green pinecones. Some kid is feeding geese but also terrified of geese, it would \\nseem \\n\\nWoman to man: \"If someone could turn down the wind, \\nthat would be great.\"\\n\\nMan talking to woman w/ cane: Something \"smells like a dead body.\"\\n\\nKids screaming on playground \\n\\nApple on the ground Incredibly varied terrain — sidewalk, subway entrance, busy traffic circle, and in the park, playground, dense woods, bridge, rock outcropping, paths.\\n\\nA teenager doing wheelies on Cathedral Parkway, boy with superhero face paint carrying animal-balloon sword took his mother\\'s hand as he descended subway steps. Kids skateboarding by the statue of Frederick Douglass in the middle of the circle.\\n\\nI saw a man stop his bike on West Drive and pull out his phone to take a picture of something and followed his view and there was the squirrel, gamboling along on the grass by some exposed rock. S/he alternated quickly — poke around on the ground, look up to assess danger, walk a few steps, poke around, look up, walk. S/he had a beautiful coat — gray with thick cinammon highlights — and a proud tail that did a flowing slinky-like motion with every change of position. After about 20 seconds, s/he darted off into a thicket heading down the embankment to where the screams of children echoed from the swings. Squirrel #1 foraging — buried something before circling area. Good birds not so many squirrels :( Central Park North busy with traffic — loud busses.\\n\\nPlayground quiet — two families. chipmunks, sm. rat, goldfinch\\nsparrows, starlings, dove, robin, jay\\n- central park north had lots of homeless + garbage \\n- chipmunk + sm. rat chasing each other \\n- two squirrels chasing each other (one had nut, the other ended up stealing the nut) Squirrel #3 was very hungry -- he was foraging a lot. - He didn\\'t care about people or bikes/children. \\n\\nA young homeless man approached me. He was very polite, introduced himself and explained he was discharged from a Juvenile homeless shelter. He was very timid -- respectful, and when I handed him the only dollar I had, his eyes lit up. It made me feel grateful that we were counting squirrels. A pack of bikers was hanging around for a while/lots of cars on the street/people at benches. Very sad at lack of squirrel friends.\\n\\nA pack of bikers was hanging around for a while/lots of cars on the street/people at benches. Very sad at lack of squirrel friends. I verified this part of the map in June! Stewart and I rendezvoused at the triangle just outside the hectare.\\n\\nFirst squirrel sighting was just outside hectare.\\n\\nConstruction going on across 110th Street, just outside hectare. Noise affects hectare, and of course 110th is included, but otherwise calm hectare.\\n\\nLitter more toward edge of park: plastic cup, receipt, gum wrappers, can tabs, cigarette butts, bags, bottles — mostly signs of humans having been there. Lots around benches on sidewalk. But! There was a CPC employee blowing it away. \\n\\nNo squirrels on sidewalk.\\n\\nGot asked for money or food, not by a squirrel. Discovered the smell of a gingko fruit! Very pungent. (Across 123 Central Park North) Mallards! \\nCanadian Geese! One or two squirrels of the same Litter: Some but lots on 110th Street in park.\\n\\nSquirrel #1 had nut in mouth, dug many times before finding place to leave it. Most of the zone is taken over by a playground with shrieking children and gaggles of geese. Then, from the skies! A red-tailed hawk drops down, strikes a rat! The rat sits, dying slowly. People hardly notice the hawk. The starlings seem unconcerned. Cool playground. I took advantage of no one being in the playground to explore inside. Technically adults without a child are not allowed in. The playground is surrounded by landscaping and one section has an area for children to explore. Found all squirrels in this natural playground section — also taking advantage of area since no one was around. Man in Falcons cap raising a fit, upset with woman. \\n\\nKids playing.\\n\\nSaw Squirrel #4 pat the ground. Got excited. grey body, red head — exquisite. These two appeared to be engaging in a flirtatious yet combative ritual, ending up out of sight high up in a tree. Very quiet for squirrel activity but glad I managed to spot two squirrels in the fenced area. Homeless couple under tree\\nBunch of mallards (Meer bank)\\nHeard a goose — didn\\'t see it\\nSmall bird with stripes\\n(like a hummingbird)\\nMan fishing in the Meer\\nChipmunk crossing East Drive I saw squirrel #1 chase squirrel #2 away from a tree. They did 3 spiral loops around a tree. A tiny apricot-colored dog bounded like a rabbit. His owner explained he had found a small green ball (a tennis ball in its former life?) and he, the dog, was so happy. The ball kept falling out of his mouth, it was too big for the dog to carry.\\n\\nNearby, a German Shepherd barked at every passerby. A walker stopped to talk to it — his way of \"barking\" back.'"
